2803-161169-0006 look a little closer while our guide lets the light of his lamp fall upon the black wall at her side
2803-161169-0013 then the hills were piled up on top of it all but here and there some edge of a coal bed was tilted up and appeared above the ground
2902-9006-0000 one who writes of such an era labours under a troublesome disadvantage
2902-9006-0001 in the present case that disadvantage is doubled for while the sins of the church however heinous were still such as admit of being expressed in words the sins of the heathen world against which she fought were utterly indescribable and the christian apologist is thus compelled for the sake of decency to state the churchs case far more weakly than the facts deserve
2902-9006-0013 the huns singly their inferiors pressed them from behind with the irresistible weight of numbers italy with her rich cities and fertile lowlands beckoned them on to plunder as auxiliaries they had learned their own strength and roman weakness a casus belli was soon found

3000-15664-0010 every crystal dances responsive to the touches of the sun and the currents of sap in the growing cells of all the vegetation are ever in a vital whirl and rush and though many feet and wings are folded how many are astir
3000-15664-0021 regaining the low ground at the base of the mountain and holding on in your grand orbit you pass through a belt of juniper woods called the cedars to sheep rock at the foot of the shasta pass
3000-15664-0024 large flocks dwell here from year to year winter and summer descending occasionally into the adjacent sage plains and lava beds to feed but ever ready to take refuge in the jagged crags of their mountain at every alarm
3000-15664-0029 then fell the gloaming making everything still more forbidding and mysterious
3000-15664-0045 the great wilds of our country once held to be boundless and inexhaustible are being rapidly invaded and overrun in every direction and everything destructible in them is being destroyed
3081-166546-0008 george
3081-166546-0019 i asked as soon as george had returned to my side
3081-166546-0047 very well then youre in a position to poor near me

3536-23268-0027 what he said he looked with so much sincerity that had she been burning with rage at his late behaviour she must have forgiven him for the regret which he so forcibly expressed
3536-23268-0030 keep your appointment and be assured that i shall issue my commands with more circumspection for the future as i find how strictly they are complied with
3536-8226-0022 missus bozzle who well understood that business was business and that wives were not business felt no anger at this and handed her husband his best coat
3576-138058-0012 dont guiojey did so and asked him what had happened to him and what he was afraid of
3576-138058-0015 he was mounted upon a powerful horse and had on a coat of mail with four of the pistols they call petronels in that country at his waist
3576-138058-0019 give me my horse and arms and wait for me here i will go in quest of this knight and dead or alive i will make him keep his word plighted to so great beauty

3752-4943-0024 just as he reached it however the figure of mister north rose from behind a pile of stones
3752-4944-0000 captain frere says that the scenery is delightful
3752-4944-0001 abandoned indeed by god and man almost

3752-4944-0064 it was as though he had reached the crisis of a disease which had been for days gathering force
3853-163249-0002 so christy turned to defer to her prophetic soul and gave herself up to the blissful holiday that had come at last
3853-163249-0005 im not a talker you know and as the laws of gravitation forbid my soaring aloft anywhere i can only express my joyfully uplifted state of mind by prancing as you call it

5536-43358-0008 at the solemn hour of sunrise or sonstad he took up his position overlooking the glories of earth and facing the great mystery and there he remained naked erect silent and motionless exposed to the elements and forces of his arming for a night and a day to two days and nights but rarely longer

5694-64025-0022 the rope however was stronger than the mules no and he was finally prevailed upon by the strength of the rope to cross the creek
5694-64025-0023 and why taking the rope off he shook himself and seemed to say you think that you are mighty smart folks but you are a leetle too smart
5694-64029-0019 we were right upon the yankee line on the wookersoneturnpite

6319-64726-0007 one said it was an enchanted castle another that witches lived there but most believed that it was occupied by a great ogre which carried thither all the children he could catch and ate them up one at a time for nobody could get at him through the wood
6345-64257-0012 but living soul there could be none to meet
6345-64257-0013 she had lost him years and years before and now she saw him he was there and she knew him
6345-64257-0020 with that came a pang of intense pain
6345-93302-0002 you see that she knew exactly how a tryst is conducted in the pages of the standard poets and of the cheaper weekly journals
6345-93302-0005 she only wished for may and the orchard instead of january and the dingy dusty waiting room the plain faced preoccupied travellers the dim desolate weather
6345-93302-0011 her hands and feet were aching with cold
6345-93302-0013 she said how frightfully cold it is
