AE_100 THE WALLS OF THE ROOMS WERE DISCORDANTLY PAPERED
AE_101 THEN SHE WALKED AND SANG TO IT UNTIL HANSON DISTURBED IN HIS READING CAME AND TOOK IT
AE_102 HE SEEMED TO BE THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE
AE_103 MANY BEGAN TO EXPLAIN BUT HER HUSBAND TOOK THIS PART OF THE CONVERSATION TO HIMSELF
AE_104 SHE ASKED MINNIE FOR INK AND PAPER WHICH WERE UPON THE MANTEL IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN THE LATTER HAD GONE TO BED AT TEN GOT OUT DREW HIS CARD AND WROTE HIM
AE_105 IT WAS UNDER SUCH AUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SHE STARTED OUT THIS MORNING TO LOOK FOR WORK
AE_106 HE WAS IN A FEVERED STATE OF MIND OWING TO THE BLIGHT HIS WIFES ACTION THREATENED TO CAST UPON HIS ENTIRE FUTURE
AE_107 HURSTWOOD WALKED THE FLOOR MENTALLY ARRANGING THE CHIEF POINTS OF HIS SITUATION
AE_108 HE ALSO THOUGHT OF HIS MANAGERIAL POSITION
AE_109 HOW WOULD THE PAPERS TALK ABOUT IT
AE_10 FROM OUR BENCH WE COULD SEE WHAT A HOLLOW CASE HIS BODY WAS
AE_110 FOR SOME REASON HE FELT AS IF SOMETHING MIGHT COME THAT WAY AND WAS RELIEVED WHEN ALL THE ENVELOPES HAD BEEN SCANNED AND NOTHING SUSPICIOUS NOTICED
AE_111 SO LITTLE DID HE CONSIDER DREW A THAT IT NEVER ONCE OCCURRED TO HIM TO WORRY ABOUT HIS FINDING OUT
AE_112 HE WOULD GET ONE TO DAY IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ON HIS DESK WHEN HE GOT BACK HE WOULD LOOK FOR IT AT ONCE
AE_113 HE WENT IN AND EXAMINED HIS LETTERS BUT THERE WAS NOTHING FROM CARRIE
AE_114 AT ONE THIRTY HE WENT TO RECTORS FOR LUNCH AND WHEN HE RETURNED A MESSENGER WAS WAITING FOR HIM
AE_115 THEN HE SAT DOWN IN HIS CHAIR AND GAZED WITHOUT SEEING CONTEMPLATING THE RESULT OF HIS WORK
AE_116 LATER HOWEVER HIS OLD DISCRETION ASSERTED ITSELF
AE_117 THE LONG DRISSELRADBEGUNPEDESTRIANS OLLARSANDTROUSERS AT THE BOTTOM
AE_118 HURSTWOODALMOSTEXCLAIMEDOUTLOUDATTHEINSISTENCYOFTHISTHING
AE_119 HE PUT ON HIS HAT AND LOOKED AROUND FOR HIS UMBRELLA
AE_11 GRADUALLY RELIEF CAME TO ALL OF US
AE_120 HE WOULD GO IN AND SEE ANYHOW HE WOULD HAVE NO ROW
AE_121 HE RANG AGAIN THIS TIME HARDER STILL NO ANSWER
AE_122 WHEN HURSTWOOD GOT BACK TO HIS OFFICE AGAIN HE WAS IN A GREATER QUANDARY THAN EVER
AE_123 HE COULD HARDLY REALISE HOW IT HAD ALL COME ABOUT
AE_124 NO LETTER HAD COME NO WORD OF ANY KIND AND YET HERE IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING AND SHE HAD AGREED TO MEET HIM THAT MORNING
AE_125 HE SAW THAT IN THE EXCITEMENT OF RECENT EVENTS HE HAD NOT FORMULATED A PLAN UPON THAT
AE_126 HE WAS GETTING SOME VAGUE COMFORT OUT OF A GOOD CIGAR BUT IT WAS NO PANACEA FOR THE ILL WHICH AFFECTED HIM
AE_127 THEN HE CALLED HARRY THE BOY OF ALL WORK AROUND THE PLACE
AE_128 YOU TAKE THIS TO THIS ADDRESS HE SAID HANDING HIM THE ENVELOPE AND GIVE IT TO MISSUS HURSTWOOD YES SIR SAID THE BOY
AE_129 THE BOY HASTENED AWAY AND THE MANAGER FELL TO HIS MUSINGS
AE_12 MISTER SHIMERDA WENT WITH HIM
AE_130 HE WAS BEATEN FOR TO NIGHT AND HE MIGHT JUST AS WELL MAKE THE BEST OF IT
AE_131 SHE WOULD TAKE THE ENVELOPE AND KNOW THAT SHE HAD TRIUMPHED
AE_132 ALL THE TIME HIS THOUGHTS WOULD RUN OUT TO HIS HOME AND SEE THE SCENE BEING THEREIN ENACTED
AE_133 IN ABOUT AN HOUR AND THREE QUARTERS THE BOY RETURNED
AE_134 HOW ABOUT THAT NOW HIS PAIN AT HER FAILURE TO MEET OR WRITE HIM RAPIDLY INCREASED AS HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THE SUBJECT
AE_135 HE DECIDED TO WRITE HER CARE OF THE WEST SIDE POST OFFICE AND ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION AS WELL AS TO HAVE HER MEET HIM
AE_136 THREE OCLOCK CAME FOUR FIVE SIX AND NO LETTER
AE_137 THE HELPLESS MANAGER PACED THE FLOOR AND GRIMLY ENDURED THE GLOOM OF DEFEAT
AE_138 HE THOUGHT A BUSY SATURDAY USHERED OUT THE SABBATH IN AND NOTHING DONE
AE_13 AFTER THE CEREMONY AT THE CHURCH THE PARTY WENT TO A DINNER GIVEN BY THE PARENTS OF THE BRIDE
AE_140 IT WAS THE WORST SUNDAY HE HAD SPENT IN HIS LIFE
AE_141 IT SEEMED AS IF HIS FAMILY TROUBLES WERE JUST BEGINNING
AE_142 HE DID MANAGE TO BRING HIMSELF INTO THE MOOD TO GO OUT TO CARRY BUT WHEN HE GOT IN OGDEN PLACE HE THOUGHT HE A MAN WATCHING HIM AND WENT AWAY
AE_143 HE DID NOT GO WITHIN A BLOCK OF THE HOUSE
AE_144 A WENCEDAYTHERECEIVED ANOTHER POLITE NOTE FROM MC GREGOR JAMES AND HAY IT READ
AE_145 DEAR SIR WE BEG TO INFORM YOU THAT WE ARE INSTRUCTED TO WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW THURSDAY AT ONE OCLOCK BEFORE FILING SUIT AGAINST YOU ON BEHALF OF MISSUS JULIA HURSTWOOD FOR DIVORCE AND ALIMONY
AE_146 VERY TRULY YOURS ET CETERA COMPROMISE
AE_147 SO HERE IT WAS SPREAD OUT CLEAR BEFORE HIM AND NOW HE KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT
AE_148 IF HE DIDNT GO AND SEE THEM THEY WOULD SUE HIM PROMPTLY
AE_149 PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION
AE_14 THERE ARE ONLY THREE SLEDGES LEFT HE WHISPERED
AE_150 THIS IS A MISTAKE THOUGH A PERFECTLY NATURAL ONE
AE_151 ON MY RETURN I PURPOSELY AVOIDED LOOKING INTO IT UNTIL I HAD SENT BACK MY LAST REVISES TO THE PRINTER
AE_152 I MUST NOT CONCLUDE WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY MOST SINCERE THANKS TO MY CRITICS AND TO THE PUBLIC FOR THE LENIENCY AND CONSIDERATION WITH WHICH THEY HAVE TREATED MY ADVENTURES
AE_153 IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE UPPER RAGETHITODISTRICT OF THE CANTERBURY PROVINCE AS IT THEN WAS OF NEW ZEALAND AND APPEARED AT CHRISTCHURCH IN THE PRESS NEWSPAPER JUNE THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
AE_154 I MADE A FEW FURTHER VERY TRIFLING ALTERATIONS BEFORE MOULDS WERE TAKEN BUT SINCE THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO AS NEW EDITIONS WERE FROM TIME TO TIME WANTED THEY HAVE BEEN PRINTED FROM STEREOS THEN MADE
AE_155 IF THE READER WILL EXCUSE ME I WILL SAY NOTHING OF MY AUNTASEDANCENOREOF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED ME TO LEAVE MY NATIVE COUNTRY THE NARRATIVE WOULD BE TEDIOUS TO HIM AND PAINFUL TO MYSELF
AE_156 IT WILL BE SEEN THAT I DID NOT SUCCEED IN MY DESIGN AND THAT HOWEVER MUCH I MAY HAVE MET WITH THAT WAS NEW AND STRANGE I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO REAP ANY PECUNIARY ADVANTAGE
AE_157 I REACHED MY DESTINATION IN ONE OF THE LAST MONTHS OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT BUT I DARE NOT MENTION THE SEASON LEST THE READER SHOULD GATHER IN WHICH HEMISPHERE I WAS
AE_159 I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE COUNTRY AND THE MANNER OF LIFE
AE_15 YES HOW MANY
AE_160 SO LONELY AND SO SOLEMN WITH THE SAD GREY CLOUDS ABOVE AND NO SOUND SAVE A LOST LAMB BLEATING UPON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE AS THOUGH ITS LITTLE HEART WERE BREAKING
AE_161 EACH WAS CRY LOUDER AND WANDER FARTHER YET MAY LUCK BE WITH THEM BOTH THAT THEY MAY FIND THEIR OWN AT NIGHTFALL
AE_162 THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHO HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA SAVE THOSE WHO WERE THEMSELVES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IF INDEED THERE WAS ANY ONE AT ALL COULD I HOPE TO CROSS IT
AE_163 I WOULD TRY TO NEAR A RANGE AND SEE HOW FAR I COULD GO
AE_164 MY GUIDES HOWEVER WERE WELL KNOWN AND THE NATURAL POLITENESS OF THE PEOPLE PREVENTED THEM FROM PUTTING ME TO ANY INCONVENIENCE BUT THEY COULD NOT HELP EYEING ME NOR I THEM
AE_166 EACH FEATURE WAS FINISHED EYELIDS EYELASHES AND EARS BEING ALMOST INVARIABLY PERFECT
AE_168 I HAVE ALWAYS DELIGHTED IN AND REVERENCED BEAUTY BUT I FELT SIMPLY ABASHED IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A SPLENDID TYPE A COMPOUND OF ALL THAT IS BEST IN EGYPTIAN GREEK AND ITALIAN
AE_169 THE CHILDREN WERE INFINITE IN NUMBER AND EXCEEDINGLY MERRY I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT THEY CAME IN FOR THEIR FULL SHARE OF THE PREVAILING BEAUTY
AE_16 NOW HIS MIDDLE HORSE WAS BEING ALMOST DRAGGED BY THE OTHER TWO
AE_170 I EXPRESSED BY SIGNS MY ADMIRATION AND PLEASURE TO MY GUIDES AND THEY WERE GREATLY PLEASED
AE_172 SUFFICE IT THAT I FOUND MYSELF TAKE HIM BEFORE THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AND BY HIS ORDERS WAS PLACED IN AN APARTMENT WITH TWO OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE THE FIRST I HAD SEEN LOOKING ANYTHING BUT WELL AND HANDSOME
AE_173 THE OTHER LOOKED PALE AND ILL BUT HE WAS MARVELLOUSLY SELF CONTAINED AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM
AE_175 AGAIN THERE WAS A VERY OLD CARRIAGE WHOSE WHEELS IN SPITE OF RUST AND DECAY I COULD SEE HAD BEEN DESIGNED ORIGINALLY FOR IRON RAILS
AE_177 THE REPLY WAS WRITTEN IN A SPRAWLING FEMININE HAND IT WAS A LITTLE VAGUE
AE_178 THE WHOLE THING WAS A TRIFLE ODD
AE_179 I HAVE NEVER KNOWN A MADGE AND YET FROM MY BOYHOOD UPWARD I HAVE DESIRED TO MEET ONE
AE_180 I EVEN BOUGHT SOMETHING FOR MADGE I MEAN MISSUS WILSON
AE_181 IT WAS A HORRIBLE JOURNEY
AE_182 HE WAS IMPERVIOUS TO REASON
AE_184 I DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE MEANT
AE_185 I DID NOT ASK I WAS BEYOND IT
AE_186 I WAS CHILLED TO THE BONE WET TIRED HUNGRY
AE_187 I HAD LONG BEEN WISHING THAT AN OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMAS HAD BEEN COMPLETELY EXTINCT BEFORE I HAD THOUGHT OF ADVENTURING IN QUEST OF ONE
AE_188 THERE BE THE DOOR IN FRONT OF YOU YOU GO UP THREE STEPS IF YOU CAN FIND HIM
AE_189 THERES A KNOCKER IF NONE OF EM HAVENT TWISTED IT OFF
AE_18 EVERY ONE SAID PETER KISSED THE COW BEFORE SHE WAS LED AWAY BY HER NEW OWNER
AE_190 BETTER RING AGAIN SUGGESTED THE DRIVER HARD
AE_191 THE BELL REVERBERATED THROUGH WHAT SEEMED LIKE AN EMPTY HOUSE
AE_192 PRESENTLY FEET WERE HEARD ADVANCING ALONG THE PASSAGE SEVERAL PAIRS IT SEEMED AND A LIGHT GLEAMED THROUGH THE WINDOW OVER THE DOOR
AE_193 THE INFORMATION WAS GREETED WITH WHAT SOUNDED UNCOMMONLY LIKE A CHORUS OF LAUGHTER
AE_194 THERE WAS A RUSH OF RETREATING FEET AN EXPOSTULATING VOICE THEN DARKNESS AGAIN AND SILENCE
AE_195 WHO LIVES HERE ARE THE PEOPLE MAD
AE_196 I TOLD THE BELL AGAIN
AE_197 AFTER A VAST AMOUNT OF UNFASTENING THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND ON THE THRESHOLD THERE STOOD A GIRL WITH A LIGHTED CANDLE IN HER HAND
AE_198 IM MISTER CHRISTOPHER FROM LONDON
AE_199 BUT IT IS QUITE PLAIN TO ME THAT ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MY WEDDING ARE GOING TO BE MADE BY THE SNELLINGS
AE_19 THE LOSS OF HIS TWO FRIENDS HAD A DEPRESSING EFFECT UPON OLD MISTER SHIMERDA
AE_1 PETER COULD GIVE NO VERY CLEAR ACCOUNT OF HIS TRANSACTIONS WITH CUTTER
AE_200 I DO NOT KNOW WHEN IT IS GOING TO BE BUT IT WILL BE EITHER NEXT WEEK OR THE WEEK AFTER CERTAINLY AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MOMENT AND I SHOULDNT BE AT ALL SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT ALL MARY ANNS THINGS HAD BEEN ALREADY BOUGHT AND PERHAPS SOME OF THEM
AE_201 IT MIGHT JUST AS WELL BE SOME ONE ELSES WEDDING SO UNIMPORTANT IS THE PART WHICH I AM SET TO PLAY IN IT
AE_202 THE ACCIDENT IN QUESTION OCCURRED UPON THE SUNDAY EVENING
AE_203 FROM A COUSIN OF OURS WHOS IN THAT LINE
AE_204 I NEVER SAW PEOPLE LIKE THE SNELLINGS FOR POSSESSING RELATIVES IN ALL SORTS OF LINES
AE_205 I WAS PERSUADED THAT SOMEBODY BESIDES THAT COUSIN GOT A PROFIT OUT OF MARY ANNS ENGAGEMENT RING BUT I HANDED OVER THE AMOUNT
AE_206 THERE SHE OWNS A COTTAGE OR IT MAY BE A PIGSTYE FOR ALL I KNOW
AE_207 WHEN SHE HEARD OF MY ENGAGEMENT WITH MARY ANN SHE WROTE AND SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD SPEND OUR HONEYMOON IN HER COTTAGE OR PIGSTYE AND THAT I SHOULD PAY HER RENT FOR IT
AE_208 I FOUND THAT AS A WOMAN OF BUSINESS SHE WAS BEYOND ALL MY EXPECTATIONS
AE_209 IT TURNED OUT THAT SHE HAD A LITTLE MONEY OF HER OWN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR
AE_20 WHEN HE WAS OUT HUNTING HE USED TO GO INTO THE EMPTY LOG HOUSE AND SIT THERE BROODING
AE_210 AND OF COURSE I HAD MY EXPECTATIONS AND SHE HAD HERS
AE_211 IT WAS PLAIN THAT TOGETHER WE SHOULD MANAGE MOST COMFORTABLY DELIGHTFULLY IN FACT
AE_212 I SHALL MAKE PAPA GIVE ME FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS AT LEAST
AE_213 I KNOW WHAT MAMMA CAN AFFORD TO GIVE AND I WILL SEE IF SHE GIVES IT
AE_214 I HAVE DRAWN UP A LIST OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO OUGHT TO GIVE US A PRESENT AND I SHALL TELL THEM WHAT THEY OUGHT TO GIVE IT WONT BE MY FAULT IF I DONT GET IT
AE_215 HERS HAS BEEN PRODIGIOUS
AE_216 I NOTICE THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PERSONS WHO HAVE ALREADY TENDERED THEIR OFFERINGS
AE_217 THE FACT OF HAVING GIVEN MARY ANN A WEDDING PRESENT SEEMS TO FILL THEM WITH A FEELING OF RANCOROSAIDITYWHICHTOTMEISINEXPLICABLE
AE_218 SUCH IS THE SELFISHNESS OF HUMAN NATURE
AE_219 BUT WHY ON THAT ACCOUNT THEY SHOULD PITY ME I ALTOGETHER FAIL TO UNDERSTAND
AE_21 THIS CABIN WAS HIS HERMITAGE UNTIL THE WINTER SNOWS PENNED HIM IN HIS CAVE
AE_220 WE HAVE ALL BEEN GIVING MARY ANN PRESENTS AND I SUPPOSE YOU MISTER WHITING HAVE BEEN GIVING HER SOMETHING TOO
AE_221 SOMEONE SNIGGERED
AE_222 WE ARE GOING FOR OUR HONEYMOON TO EMILY AND THE SOUTH OF FRANCE
AE_223 A SECOND COUSIN OF MARY ANNS IS IN THE COOKS TOURS LINE
AE_225 BESIDES WHICH WE CAN ALWAYS SELL THE COUPONS AND RAILWAY PASSES WHICH WE DONT USE
AE_226 SINCE HIS BIRTH HE HAS BEEN GUARDED SO CLOSELY THAT THE CLEVEREST POISONERS OF THE EAST COULD NOT REACH HIM
AE_228 THIS MAN WAS CLAD IN A BROWN CAMEL HAIR ROBE AND SANDALS AND A GREEN TURBAN WAS ON HIS HEAD
AE_229 WITH A LONG STAINED FINGERNAIL HE MAPPED THE CONSTELLATIONS ON THE MARBLE TILED FLOOR
AE_22 THROUGHOUT THIS CENTURY THE POWER OF THE CHURCH WAS CONSTANTLY ON INCREASE AND IS VISIBLE IN MANY IMPORTANT CHANGES
AE_230 THE SLANT OF THE MOON PRESAGED EVIL FOR THE KING OF THE THE STARS ARE IN TURMOIL THE SERPENT IN THE HOUSE OF THE ELEPHANT
AE_231 POINT OF CONTACT INQUIRED THE OTHER
AE_232 BUT AT THE URGENT ENTREATY OF THE PRINCESS OF KHOSALA WHO LOVED BUNDACHANDVANYHE GAVE HER A LOCK OF HIS LONG BLACK HAIR AS A TOKEN OF REMEMBRANCE
AE_233 THEY SEEK TO SNAP THE SILVER CORD THAT BINDS ME TO MY DYING BODY
AE_234 THE CLUSTER AROUND ME THEIR HANDS ARE TALONED THEIR EYES ARE RED LIKE FLAME BURNING IN DARKNESS
AE_235 I KNOW NOW WHAT BRINGS ME TO THE PYRE
AE_236 YOU WILL CRY AND THE GRIP OF YOUR FINGERS BROUGHT ME BACK BUT I AM GOING FAST
AE_237 THERE WAS THE OLD IMPERIOUS NOTE IN HIS FAILING WHISPER
AE_238 YOU HAVE NEVER DISOBEYED ME OBEY MY LAST COMMAND
AE_239 THE CIVILIAN SPECIALISTS IN OTHER FIELDS AND THE SPACE FORCE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN HOLDING TAPE LINES AND MAKING SKETCHES AND SNAPPING CAMERAS WERE ALL FLYING TO LOWER SYRTIS TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH OXYGEN THERE WAS AND WHAT KIND OF LIFE HAD SUPPORTED
AE_23 THE ANCESTORS OF THE PRESENT PRETENDER CONGAL SURNAMED THE SQUINT EYED HAD TWICE RECEIVED AND CHERISHED THE LOSENTIOUSBARDSWHENUNDERTHEBANOFTARAANDTHISPOPULARITYTWITHTHATSTILLPOWERFULTORDERWASONEPROPOFHISAMBITION
AE_240 THEY HAD FOUR OR FIVE SPECIES OF WHAT MIGHT LOOSELY BE CALLED BIRDS AND SOMETHING THAT COULD EASILY BE CLASSED AS A REPTILE AND A CARNIVOROUS MAMMAL THE SIZE OF A CAT WITH BIRDLIKE CLAWS AND A HERBIVORE ALMOST IDENTICAL WITH THE PIGLIKE THING IN THE BIG DARFHULVA MURAL AND ANOTHER LIKE A GAZELLE WITH A SINGLE HORN IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS FOREHEAD
AE_241 TONYSFOUNDTHEMARTIANS
AE_242 GLORIOUS STANDISHOWHOHADROPPED IN FOR LUNCH WAS ON THE MEZZANINE FAIRLY SCREAMING INTO A RADIOPHONE EXTENSION DOESNT THAT A HALF OF THEM
AE_243 WELL OF COURSE THEYRE DEAD WHAT A QUESTION
AE_244 MARTHA REMEMBERED THE CLOSED DOOR ON THE FIRST SURVEY THEY HADNT ATTEMPTED OPENING IT
AE_245 NOW IT WAS BURNED AWAY AT BOTH SIDES AND LAY STILL HOT ALONG THE EDGES ON THE FLOOR OF THE BIG OFFICE ROOM IN FRONT
AE_247 MASS SUICIDE THATS WHAT IT WAS NOTICE WHATS IN THE CORNERS
AE_248 SO THEY JUST CAME IN HERE AND LIT THE CHARCOAL AND SAT DRINKING TOGETHER TILL THEY ALL FELL ASLEEP
AE_249 TONY LATTIMER THE DISCOVERER WAS BEGINNING TO CASH IN ON HIS ATTENTIONS TO GLORIA AND HIS INGRATIATION WITH SID HE WAS ALWAYS EITHER MAKING VOICE AND IMAGE TALKS FOR TELECAST OR LISTENING TO THE NEWS FROM THE HOME PLANET
AE_24 IT IS PRETTY CLEAR ALSO THAT THE LAST RALLY OF DRUIDISM AGAINST CHRISTIANITY TOOK PLACE BEHIND HIS BANNER ON THE PLAIN OF MOIRA
AE_250 WITHOUT QUESTION HE HAD BECOME OVERNIGHT THE MOST WIDELY KNOWN ARCHAEOLOGIST IN HISTORY
AE_251 BRING IT TO THE PUBLIC ATTENTION DRAMATIZE IT
AE_252 THE ORGANIZATION OF A SOCIETY OF MARTIAN ARCHAEOLOGY WITH ANTHONY LATTIMER PH D THE LOGICAL CANDIDATE FOR THE
AE_253 INSIDE A SECRET ROCKET TELEMETERING DEVICE WAS MOUNTAIN ON ITS TEST AND
AE_255 AN INSTANT LATER IT CRASHED OVER PINNING MARK FABER BENEATH IT
AE_256 BUD THREW UP HIS ARMS TO PROTECT HIMSELF BUT TOO LATE
AE_257 FOR MINUTES NO ONE STIRRED AMONG THE WRECKAGE
AE_258 THEN TOM WHO HAD BEEN STUNNED BY SOME FALLING DEBRIS RAISED HIMSELF TO A SITTING POSITION
AE_259 TOMS EYES FOCUSED IN HORROR ON THE WRECKAGE ENVELOPED BY STILL BILLOWING DUST
AE_25 THE POETS OF SUCCEEDING AGES HAVE DWELT MUCH IN DETAIL ON THE OCCURRENCES OF THIS MEMORABLE DAY
AE_260 THE SKY WAS VISIBLE THROUGH SEVERAL GAPING HOLES IN THE ROOF WHICH WAS SAGGING DANGEROUSLY ON ITS SUPPORTING TRUSSES
AE_261 THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAD JUST NOTICED HIS FRIEND LYING PINNED BENEATH A HEAVY BEAM NEARBY
AE_262 LETS SEE ABOUT GETTING HELP FOR MISTER FABER
AE_263 WITHIN MINUTES TOM WAS IN CHARGE OF CLEARING AWAY RUBBLE AND EXTRICATING ANYONE WHO MIGHT BE TRAPPED INSIDE THE BUILDINGS
AE_264 THE TELEPHONE LINE WAS SOON REPAIRED AND A STEADY STREAM OF RESCUE VEHICLES BEGAN ARRIVING FROM HARKNESS FIRE TRUCKS THREE AMBULANCES AND PRIVATE CARS DRIVEN BY VOLUNTEERS
AE_265 THE TWO GIRLS WERE AS MUCH UPSET AS TOMS MOTHER TOM LAUGHED
AE_266 MISTER SWIFT CAME INTO THE LIVING ROOM JUST THEN AND TOLD TOM HOW WORRIED MISSUS SWIFT AND SANDY HAD BEEN
AE_267 HE SMILED GUILTILY AS HE ADDED BUT I MUST ADMIT I WAS MORE THAN A LITTLE CONCERNED MYSELF
AE_268 HE IS A GREAT SCIENTIST
AE_269 TOM NODDED UNHAPPILY
AE_270 MALE OR FEMALE HUMAN OR ANIMAL
AE_271 MISTER SWIFTS EYES TWINKLED
AE_272 FORTUNATELY WILL HALE WAS NOT A MAN IN A HURRY AND DID NOT USE A PRESS OF CANRISSORTHISMASTSWOULDINEVITABLYWHAVECOME
AE_273 THEIR FRIENDS DID THEIR BEST TO AMUSE HIM
AE_274 THEIR MINDS WERE SO DISTRACTED AT THIS CHANGE OF ROUTE AS TO BE QUITE UNHINGED
AE_275 GOD KEEP US FROM SUCH A MEETING WHY JOHN
AE_276 WE COULD NOT EVEN FLY FLY JEN
AE_277 YES MY LORD WE SHOULD TRY IN VAIN
AE_278 WE WOULD FIGHT TO THE DEATH OF COURSE BUT AFTER THAT
AE_279 SO THAT ON THAT SCORE THERE IS LITTLE OR NO DANGER
AE_27 AS LEADING TO THE MENTION OF OTHER INTERESTING EVENTS WE MUST SET THIS INROAD CLEARLY BEFORE THE READER
AE_280 BUT AS TO GETTING ALONGSIDE THE DUNKIN GOD FOR BED
AE_281 THEY WERE NOT TO LEAVE IT AGAIN TILL THE TOPS OF THE WHIHEETY RANGES WERE LIT FOR THE FIRST FIRES OF DAY
AE_282 GOD WHO READS OUR HEARTS KNOWS THAT WE HAD A NOBLE END IN VIEW
AE_283 BOLINARVAN'SVOIYSFIRMTILNOWFALTERED
AE_284 MY LORD WHICHEVER OF SURVIVES THE OTHER WILL FULFILL THE WISH OF LADY HELEN AND MARRIED GRANT
AE_285 THE JAILER MAY FORGET THAT HE IS ON GUARD THE PRISONER NEVER FORGETS THAT HE IS GUARDED
AE_286 ON THAT SIDE DESCENT WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE BOTTOM WAS SHUT IN BY THE ENORMOUS ROCK
AE_287 THE JOHNMANGLESINSERTING AD OF HIS PONIARD AVOIDED THE KNIFE WHICH NOW PROTRUDED ABOVE THE SOIL BUT SEIZED THE HAND THAT WIELDED IT
AE_288 MY CHILD MY CHILD MURMURED LADY HELENA THE SAVAGES DID NOT KILL YOU
AE_289 ONCE IT WAS A FATHER WHO THOUGHT HE WOULD BUILD FOR HIS CHILDREN A BEAUTIFUL HOME PUTTING INTO IT EVERY THING THEY COULD NEED OR DESIRE THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES
AE_290 WHY DID HE GIVE THAT SO ODD A SHAPE OR SO STRANGE A COVERING
AE_291 AND SO THROUGH MANY QUESTIONS AND MANY EXPERIMENTS THEY LEARN AT LAST HOW TO USE THE CONTENTS OF THIS ONE STOREHOUSE
AE_292 THE ENTRANCE IS LIGHT BECAUSE IT OPENS SO WIDE BUT WE CAN SEE THAT THE FLOOR SLOPES DOWNWARD AND THE WAY LOOKS DARK AND NARROW BEFORE US
AE_293 LOOK A LITTLE CLOSER WHILE OUR GUIDE LETS THE LIGHT OF HIS LAMP FALL UPON THE BLACK WALL AT YOUR SIDE
AE_295 FERNS AND PALMS MOSSES AND TREES AND ANIMALS ALL PERFECT ALL BEAUTIFUL AND YET ALL HIDDEN AWAY UNDER THIS HILL AND TURNED INTO SHINING BLACK COAL NOW I CAN VERY WELL REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST SAW A COAL FIRE AND HOW ODD IT LOOKED TO SEE WHAT SEEMED TO BE BURNING STONES
AE_296 FROM WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL WE ALWAYS HAD LOGS OF WOOD BLAZING IN AN OPEN FIREPLACE AND SO DID MANY OTHER PEOPLE AND COAL WAS JUST COMING INTO USE FOR FUEL
AE_297 WHAT SHOULD WE HAVE DONE IF EVERYBODY HAD KEPT ON BURNING WOOD TO THIS DAY
AE_298 IT WAS ONLY A TROUBLE TO THE GAS MAKERS WHO HAD NO USE FOR IT AND EVEN THREW IT AWAY UNTIL SOME ONE MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN THE OTHERS FOUND OUT THAT WATER WOULD NOT PASS THROUGH IT
AE_299 DONT YOU SEE HOW MANY USES WE HAVE FOUND FOR THIS REFUSE COAL TAR
AE_29 THE BARREN ROCK ABOUT THREE MILES IN LENGTH WAS COVERED WITH MONASTIC BUILDINGS AND ITS CEMETERY WAS ALREADY ADORNED WITH THE TOMBS OF SAINTS AND KINGS
AE_2 WE LAY STILL AND DID NOT TALK
AE_300 WHEN YOUR HANDS OR LIPS ARE CRACKED AND ROUGH FROM THE COLD DOES YOUR MOTHER EVER PUT ON GLISTERING TO HEAL THEM
AE_302 NOT BE IT EVER REMEMBERED THAT THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF IMMORALITY ATTACHES EITHER TO THE HEROINE OF THIS BOOK OR TO THE LEADING PHILOSOPHERS OF HER SCHOOL FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES
AE_304 THE VERY EMPERORS HAD ARRAYED THEMSELVES ON HER SIDE
AE_305 BUT IF THE EMPERORS HAD BECOME CHRISTIAN THE EMPIRE HAD NOT
AE_308 THE MENS SANA MUST HAVE A CORPUS SANUM TO INHABIT
AE_309 AND THE NEW BLOOD AT THE ERA OF THIS STORY WAS AT HAND
AE_30 NOW EVERY MISSIONARY THAT EVER WENT OUT FOR IONA HAD TAUGHT THAT TO REDUCE CHRISTIANS TO SLAVERY WAS WHOLLY INCONSISTENT WITH A BELIEF IN THE DOCTRINES OF THE
AE_310 TRIBEAFTERTRIBEWASECROWDINGIDOWNTOTHEALPSANDTRAMPLINGUPONEACHSOTHEREONTHEFRONTIERSOFTHEEMPIRE
AE_311 THE HUNS SINGLY THEIR INFERIORS PRESSED THEM FROM BEHIND WITH THE IRRESISTIBLE WEIGHT OF NUMBERS ITALY WITH HER RICH CITIES AND FERTILE LOWLANDS BECKONED THEM ON TO PLUNDER AS AUXILIARIES THEY HAD LEARNED THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND ROMAN WEAKNESS A CASUS BELLI WAS SOON FOUND
AE_312 THE COUNLOUSTREASURES WHICH FIVE CENTURIES OF RAPINE HAD ACCUMULATED ROUND THE CAPITOL HAD BECOME THE PREY OF MEN CLOTHED IN SHEEPSKINS AND HORSE HIDE AND THE SISTER OF AN EMPEROR HAD FOUND HER BEAUTY VIRTUE AND PRIDE OF RACE WORTHILY MATCHED BY THOSE OF THE HARD HANDED NORTHERN HERO WHO LED HER AWAY FROM ITALY AS HIS CAPTIVE AND HIS BRIDE TO FOUND NEW KINGDOMS IN SOUTH FRANCE AND SPAIN AND TO DRIVE THE NEWLY ARRIVED VANDALS ACROSS THE STRAITS OF GIBRALTAR INTO THE THEN BLOOMING COAST LAND NORTHERN
AE_314 THAT WONDERFUL METAPHYSIC SUBTLETY WHICH IN PHRASES AND DEFINITIONS TOO OFTEN UNMEANING TO OUR GROSSER INTELLECT SAW THE SYMBOLS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SPIRITUAL REALITIES AND FELT THAT ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN OMALOSEUSANDWHOMAIOSIUSMIGHTHANG THE SOLUTION OF THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF HUMANITY WAS SET TO BATTLE IN ALEXANDRIA THE ANCIENT STRONGHOLD OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY WITH THE FEET REMAINS OF THE VERY SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT TO WHICH IT OWED IT EXTRAORDINARY CULTURE
AE_316 I CANNOT HOPE THAT THESE PAGES WILL BE ALTOGETHER FREE FROM AN OCCRANISMSANDERRORS
AE_317 THE PLACE SEEMED FRAGRANT WITH ALL THE RICHES OF GREEK THOUGHT AND SONG SINCE THE DAYS WHEN TOLDHIMEPHILADELPHUSWALKED THERE WITH EUCLID AND THEOCRITUS CALEMAUS AND LIKE A FROG
AE_318 THE ROOM HAD NEITHER CARPET NOR FIREPLACE AND THE ONLY MOVABLES IN IT WERE A SOFA BED A TABLE AND AN ARM CHAIR ALL OF SUCH DELICATE AND GRACEFUL FORMS AS MAY BE SEEN ON ANCIENT VASES OF A FAR EARLIER PERIOD THAN THAT WHEREOF WE WRITE
AE_31 WHILE THE LIBERATED EXILES REJOICED ON THE PLAIN OF MEATH THE TENT OF THE ABBOT OF IONA WAS PITCHED ON THE RATH OF TARA A FACT WHICH WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT ALREADY IN LITTLE MORE THAN A CENTURY SINCE THE INTERDICT HAD FALLEN ON IT THE EDIFICES WHICH MADE SO FINE A SHOW IN THE DAYS OF PATRICK WERE RUINED AND UNINHABITABLE
AE_320 SHE HAS LIFTED HER EYES OFF HER MANUSCRIPT SHE IS LOOKING OUT WITH KINDLING COUNTENANCE OVER THE GARDENS OF THE MUSEUM HER RIPE CURLING GREEK LIPS SUCH AS WE NEVER SEE NOW EVEN AMONG HER OWN WIVES AND SISTERS OPEN
AE_321 IF THEY HAVE CAST OFF THE LONGER HEARD THEY HAVE NOT CAST OFF HYPATIA
AE_322 I TO BELIEVE AGAINST THE AUTHORITY OF PORPHYRY HIMSELF TOO IN EVIL LIZ IN MAGIC
AE_323 HOW CAN HE WHOSE SPHERE LIES ABOVE THE STARS STOOP EVERY MOMENT TO EARTH
AE_324 THERE IS FRUIT WITH LENTILS AND RICE WAITING FOR YOU IN THE NEXT ROOM AND BREAD UNLESS YOU DESPISE IT TOO MUCH
AE_325 NOT THAT SUCH A CREATURE AS THAT DISTURBS ME NO CREATED THING I HOPE CAN MOVE MY EQUANIMITY BUT IF I COULD STOOP TO HATE I SHOULD HATE HER HATE HER
AE_326 AND HER VOICE TOOK A TONE WHICH MADE IT SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN WHETHER IN SPITE OF ALL THE LOFTY IMPASSIBILITY WHICH SHE FELT BOUND TO POSSESS SHE DID NOT HATE PELAGIA WITH A MOST HUMAN AND MUNDANE HATRED
AE_327 SHASTARAMBLESANDMODOCMEMORIES
AE_328 ARCTIC BEAUTY AND DESOLATION WITH THEIR BLESSINGS AND DANGERS ONLY BE FOUND HERE TO TEST THE ENDURANCE AND SKILL OF ADVENTUROUS CLAMOROUS BUT FAR BETTER THAN CLIMBING THE MOUNTAIN IS GOING AROUND ITS WARM FRTLEBASE ENJOYING ITS BOUNTIES LIKE A BEE CIRCLING AROUND A BANK OF FLOWERS
AE_329 PERHAPS THE PROFESSION OF DOING GOOD MAY BE FULL BUT EVERY BODY SHOULD BE KIND AT LEAST TO HIMSELF
AE_32 SO SLOW AND PATIENT IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH CHRISTIANITY INFUSES ITSELF INTO THE SOCIAL LIFE OF A CONVERTED PEOPLE
AE_330 BUT IT IS FAR BETTER TO GO AFOOT
AE_331 ONLY A LITTLE FOOD WILL BE REQUIRED
AE_332 THUS ONE SAUNTERS ON AND ON IN THE GLORIOUS RADIANCE IN UTTER PEACE AND FORGETFULNESS OF
AE_333 AT SUCH TIME ITS HEIGHT SEEMS MUCH LESS AS IF CROUCHING AND WEARY IT WERE TAKING REST
AE_334 SLIGHT RAINSTORMS ARE LIKELY TO BE ENCOUNTERED IN A TRIP ROUND THE MOUNTAIN BUT ONE MAY EASILY FIND SHELTER BENEATH WELL THATCHED TREES THAT SHED THE RAIN LIKE A ROOF
AE_335 THEN THE SHINING OF THE WET LEAVES IS DELIGHTFUL AND THE STEAMY FRAGRANCE AND THE BURST OF BIRD SONG FROM A MULTITUDE OF THRUSHES AND FINCHES AND WARBLERS THAT HAVE NESTS IN THE CHAPARRAL
AE_336 A THOUSAND THOUSAND VOICES ARE HEARD BUT SO FINELY BLENDED THEY SEEM A PART OF THE NIGHT ITSELF AND MAKE A DEEPER SILENCE
AE_337 IT IS LINED WITH EMERALD ALGAE AND MOSSES AND SHADED WITH ALDER WILLOW AND THORN BUSHES WHICH GIVE IT A FINE SETTING
AE_338 MOST OF THE DRAINAGE OF THE GLACIER VANISHES AT ONCE IN THE POROUS ROCKS TO APPEAR IN SPRINGS IN THE DISTANT VALLEY AND IT IS ONLY IN TIME OF FLOOD THAT THE CHANNEL CARRIES MUCH WATER THEN THERE ARE SEVERAL FINE FALLS IN THE GORGE SIX HUNDRED FEET OR MORE IN HEIGHT
AE_339 LARCH FLOCKS DWELL HERE FROM YEAR TO YEAR WINTER AND SUMMER DESCENDING OCCASIONALLY INTO THE ADJACENT SAGE PLAINS AND LAVA BEDS TO FEED BUT EVER READY TO TAKE REFUGE IN THE JAGGED CRAGS OF THEIR MOUNTAIN AT EVERY ALARM
AE_33 HERE THE HOLY PRELATE OF FERNS MET HIM AND RELATED A VISION IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO DEMAND THE ABOLITION OF THE IMPOSED
AE_340 WHILE TRAVELING WITH A COMPANY OF HUNTERS I SAW ABOUT FIFTY IN ONE FLOCK
AE_341 THE MULE DEER ARE NEARLY AS HEAVY
AE_342 THEIR LONG MASSIVE EARS GIVE THEM A VERY STRIKING APPEARANCE
AE_343 THEN DARKNESS LIKE DEATH
AE_344 TWO OR THREE MILES FARTHER ON IS THE MAIN STRONGHOLD OF THE MODOCS HELD BY THEM SO LONG AND DEFIANTLY AGAINST ALL THE SOLDIERS THAT COULD BE BROUGHT TO THE ATTACK
AE_345 THE DUCKS LESS WARY KEPT THEIR PLACES MERELY SWIMMING IN AND OUT THROUGH OPENINGS IN THE RUSHES RIPPLING THE GLASSY WATER AND RAISING SPANGLES IN THEIR WAKE
AE_346 SHOULD THE VOLUME OF THE STREAM WHERE YOU STRIKE IT SEEM SMALL THEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT YOU ARE ABOVE THE SPRING IF LARGE NEARLY EQUAL TO ITS VOLUME AT ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE PITT RIVER THEN YOU ARE BELOW IT AND IN EITHER CASE HAVE ONLY TO FOLLOW THE RIVER UP OR DOWN UNTIL YOU COME TO IT
AE_348 TRACING RIVERS TO THEIR FOUNTAINS MAKES THE MOST CHARMING OF TRAVELS
AE_34 THE TRIBUTE WAS AT THIS PERIOD ENORMOUS FIFTEEN THOUSAND HEAD OF CATTLE ANNUALLY
AE_350 EVERY LANDSCAPE LOW AND HIGH SEEMS DOOMED TO BE TRAMPLED AND HARRIED
AE_351 INSTANTLY THEY ABSORBED ALL MY ATTENTION THOUGH I DARED NOT GIVE THEM A DIRECT LOOK AND CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THEM ONLY IN THE GLASS
AE_352 YES AND A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE
AE_353 THE BOYS BELONG TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IS A WIDOWER
AE_354 GEORGE NODDED
AE_355 DO THEY STILL INSIST THAT MISS CHALLONER WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE ROOM WITH THEM AT THIS TIME
AE_356 HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SUICIDE
AE_357 THE BOYS LOOK WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH BUT WHO CAN TELL I WOULD SOONER BELIEVE THAT
AE_358 A MAN WAS LOOKING IN FROM THE CARTER BEHIND A THE FOUR PERSONS WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING
AE_359 I INQUIRED OF GEORGE WITH MY EYES STILL ON THIS PRTISHWATCHER
AE_35 SENBOWLINGSURVIVEDHIMTHREEYEARS AND SAINT A DOWMNAN SO INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH HIS REIGN TEN YEARS
AE_360 JUST AN EVERYDAY DETECTIVE BUT AMBITIOUS I SUPPOSE AND QUITE ALIVE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING THOROUGH
AE_361 WHAT DOES HE WANT
AE_362 I ASKED AS SOON AS GEORGE HAD RETURNED TO MY SIDE
AE_363 I EMPHASISED COMPLACENTLY
AE_364 HE GAVE UP WORK SOME TIME AGO I HAVE BEEN TOLD MY HUSBAND WENT ON BUT EVIDENTLY A GREAT CASE STILL HAS ITS ALERNMENT FOR HIM
AE_365 THE TRAIL HERE MUST BE A VERY BLIND ONE FOR THEM TO CALL HIM IN
AE_366 I WISH WE HAD NOT LEFT SO SOON
AE_367 HE WAS LATE OF COURSE BUT WHEN HE DID APPEAR I ALMOST FORGOT OUR USUAL GREETING IN MY HURRY TO ASK HIM IF HE HAD SEEN THE EVENING PAPERS
AE_368 IT WAS ONE WHICH GAVE ME A SMALL TRIUMPH OVER GEORGE
AE_369 THE SUGGESTION HE HAD LAUGHED AT WAS NOT SO A TERLY FOOLISH AS HE HAD BEEN PLEASED TO CONSIDER IT
AE_36 TO MAKE GOOD HOME MADE BREAD
AE_370 THIS IS VERY GOOD OF YOU HE BEGAN GLANCING DOWN AT THE AGED DETECTIVES BUNDLED OF LAKES AND GENTLY PUSHING A CHAIR TOWARDS HIM
AE_371 BUT CLEWS THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NONE
AE_372 THAT IS WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY PERHAPS YOU CAN
AE_373 AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT WE HOPE
AE_374 ITS A CASE IN A THOUSAND GRYCE
AE_375 THE OLD MANS EYES SHOT FIRE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY ONE FOOT SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR
AE_376 SHE HAD NO COMPANION NEAR HER
AE_377 HE WAS THE PLAIN FACED DETECTIVE WHO HAD SPOKEN TO GEORGE
AE_378 THIS SWEETWATER AS THEY CALLED HIM WAS I HAVE SINCE UNDERSTOOD ONE OF HIS PROTEGES AND MORE OR LESS OF A FAVOURITE
AE_379 VERY WELL THEN YOURE IN A POSITION TO ARE NEAR
AE_37 SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN
AE_380 WELL WELL THATS HONEST AT ALL EVENTS
AE_381 ONE OR TWO OF THE MUSICIANS FROM THE END OF THE HALL
AE_382 MARK SOWERBY AND CLAUS HENNERBERG
AE_383 ANYBODY BEFORE THE FATHER CAME IN
AE_384 I SUPPOSE SHE HAS BEEN CAREFULLY QUESTIONED VERY I SHOULD SAY
AE_385 NO DOUBT
AE_386 NOT ALTOGETHER BY ME
AE_387 WHEREVER SHE PLEASES ONLY I CANT WALK FAR
AE_388 IT HAS NOT BEEN RUNNING SINCE LAST NIGHT OR IT WOULD BE FULL OF CURIOUS PEOPLE ALL THE TIME HUSTLING TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THIS PLACE
AE_389 BUT THEYLL PUT A MAN ON FOR YOU
AE_38 MODE PUT THE FLOUR INTO A LARGE EARTHENWARE BOWL OR DEEP PAN THEN WITH A STRONG METAL OR WOODEN SPOON HOLLOW OUT THE MIDDLE BUT DO NOT CLEAR IT ENTIRELY AWAY FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN AS IN THAT CASE THE SPONGE OR LEAVEN AS IT WAS FORMERLY TERMED WOULD STICK TO IT WHICH IT OUGHT NOT TO DO
AE_390 VERY GOOD MANAGE IT AS YOU WILL
AE_391 AS HER QUIET FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY SWEETWATER STOLE A GLANCE AT MISTER GRYCE
AE_392 YES
AE_393 FOR SOME LITTLE TIME THAT IS IT SEEMED LONG THOUGH I BELIEVE IT WAS NOT MORE THAN A MINUTE BEFORE TWO MEN CAME RUNNING FROM THE MUSICIANS GALLERY
AE_394 YES MANY TIMES
AE_395 WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE
AE_396 MISS CLARKE STARTED AND HER SWEET FACE SHOWED A MOMENTS PERPLEXITY DID I SHE QUERIED MUSINGLY
AE_397 NO A VERY NATURAL ONE I SHOULD SAY
AE_398 AND THE GLANCE SHE CAST HIM WHILE NOT MEETING HIS EYE SHOWED THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ADMISSION
AE_399 I WILL TROUBLE YOU NO FURTHER
AE_39 NEXT TAKE EITHER A LARGE TABLESPOONFUL OF BREAST WHICH HAS BEEN RENDERED SOLID BY MIXING IT WITH PLENTY OF COLD WATER AND LETTING IT AFTERWARDS STAND TO SETTLE FOR A DAY AND NIGHT OR NEARLY AN OUNCE OF GERMAN YEAST PUT IT INTO A LARGE BASIN AND PROCEED TO MIX IT SO THAT IT SHALL BE AS SMOOTH AS CREAM WITH THREE QUARTERS PINT OF WARM MILK AND WATER OR WITH WATER ONLY THOUGH EVEN A VERY LITTLE MILK WILL MUCH IMPROVE THE BREAD
AE_3 THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE HILLSIDE WAS SO MUCH THE COLOR OF THE NIGHT THAT WE COULD NOT SEE IT AS WE CAME UP THE DRAW
AE_400 SWEETWATERTHELPMEOUTOFTHIS
AE_402 THE NEXT MINUTE SHE WAS IN THIS LADYS ARMS
AE_404 WITH AN EDUCATION WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE ENSURED ME AN HONOURABLE STANDING IN THE WORLD WITH SOME INTELLIGENCE WIT GOOD LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND ENDOWED WITH THOSE ACCIDENTAL PHYSICAL QUALITIES WHICH ARE SUCH A GOOD PASSPORT INTO SOCIETY I FOUND MYSELF AT THE AGE OF TWENTY THE MEAN FOLLOWER OF A SUBLIME ART IN WHICH IF GREAT TALENT IS RIGHTLY ADMIRED MEDIOCRITY IS AS RIGHTLY DESPISED
AE_405 I FELT THAT IN MY FIRST PROFESSION AS I WAS NOT BLESSED WITH THE VOCATION NECESSARY TO IT I SHOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED ONLY BY DINT OF HYPOCRISY AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DESPICABLE IN MY OWN ESTIMATION EVEN IF I HAD SEEN THE PURPLE MANTLE ON MY SHOULDERS FOR THE GREATEST DIGNITIES CANNOT SILENCE A MANS ONCONSCIOUCE
AE_406 BESIDES I WAS OF OPINION THAT A MANS PROFESSION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE OUGHT TO SUPPLY HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO SATISFY ALL HIS WANTS AND THE VERY POOR PAY OF AN OFFICER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO COVER MY EXPENSES BECAUSE MY EDUCATION HAD GIVEN ME GREATER ONE THAN THOSE OF OFFICERS IN GENERAL
AE_407 OUR SCANDALOUS PROCEEDINGS OFTEN EXPOSED US TO THE GREATEST DANGER
AE_408 WE WOULD VERY OFTEN SPEND THE WHOLE NIGHT RAMBLING ABOUT THE CITY INVENTING AND CARRYING INTO EXECUTION THE MOST IMPERTINENT PRACTICAL JOKES
AE_40 ILLUSTRATION ITALIAN MILLET
AE_410 WHENEVER WE COULD CONTRIVE TO GET INTO A CHURCH TOWER WE THOUGHT IT GREAT FUN TO FRIGHTEN ALL THE PARISH BY RINGING THE ALARM BELL AS IF SOME FIRE HAD BROKEN OUT BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL WE ALWAYS CUT THE BELL ROPES SO THAT IN THE MORNING THE CHURCHWARDENS HAD NO MEANS OF SUMMONING THE FAITHFUL TO EARLY MASS
AE_411 THIS IS THE AMUSING ADVENTURE WHICH CLOSED OUR EXPLOITS
AE_412 YET THERE ARE A FEW PRIVATE ROOMS WHICH CONTAIN A TABLE SURROUNDED WITH BENCHES IN WHICH A RESPECTABLE FAMILY OR A FEW FRIENDS CAN ENJOY THEMSELVES IN A DECENT WAY
AE_414 WHERE IS MY HUSBAND
AE_415 THERE WERE FEAR YOU SHALL SEE HIM AGAIN TO MORROW
AE_416 TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS ARE NOCTURNAL ORGY BEGAN TO BE TALKED OF
AE_418 THERE WAS NO COWARDLY TRAITOR AMONGST US ALTHOUGH WE WERE ALL POOR BUT FEAR HAD ITS EFFECT AND OUR ETERNAL PRANKS WERE NOT RENEWED
AE_419 I PICKED IT UP AND COMING UP TO HIM JUST AS HE WAS GOING DOWN THE STEPS I HANDED IT TO HIM
AE_41 IT WILL GROW ON POOR SOILS AND IS EXTREMELY PRODUCTIVE
AE_420 I JUMPED OUT OF THE GONDOLA AND FOUND MYSELF ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE THREE YEARS BEFORE I HAD TAUGHT MIZETASUCHAFORCIBLELESSONTIENQUIREDFORASURGEONTATTHEFIRSTFCOFFEEHOUSEAND RAN TO THE HOUSE THAT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME
AE_421 THINKING I HAD THE RIGHT TO WATCH THE SICK MAN I SETTLED MYSELF NEAR HIS BED TO GIVE HIM EVERY CARE HE REQUIRED
AE_422 HE HAD GAMBLED AND LOST A GREAT DEAL AND HIS BROTHER WAS HIS MOST BITTER ENEMY BECAUSE HE WAS INFATUATED WITH THE IDEA THAT HE HAD TRIED TO POISON HIM
AE_423 THE POSITION WHO ATTENDED HIM WAS NAMED TERRO HE THOUGHT BY SOME PECULIAR TRAIN OF REASONING THAT HE COULD CURE HIM BY APPLYING A MACURIAL OINTMENT TO THE CHEST TO WHICH NO ONE RAISED ANY OBJECTION
AE_424 DELIGHTED WITH SUCH A FORTUNATE RESULT WE LAY DOWN AGAIN
AE_426 THE THREE FRIENDS WERE ASTOUNDED
AE_427 I DECLARED MYSELF QUITE WILLING FOR IT WAS NECESSARY TO BRAZEN IT OUT AFTER HAVING VENTURED AS FAR AS I HAD DONE
AE_428 HE WROTE THE QUESTION AND GAVE IT TO ME I READ IT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND EITHER THE SUBJECT OR THE MEANING OF THE WORDS BUT IT DID NOT MATTER I HAD TO GIVE AN ANSWER
AE_42 IT HAS BEEN INTRODUCED INTO ITALY WHERE THEY MAKE A COARSE BREAD FROM IT AND IT IS ALSO EMPLOYED IN PASTRY AND PUDDINGS THEY ALSO USE IT FOR FEEDING HORSES AND DOMESTIC FOWLS
AE_430 NOT VERY LONG I ANSWERED AND I WILL TEACH YOU AS YOU WISH ALTHOUGH THE HERMIT ASSURED ME THAT I WOULD DIE SUDDENLY WITHIN THREE DAYS IF I COMMUNICATED MY SCIENCE TO ANYONE BUT I HAVE NO FAITH WHATEVER IN THAT PREDICTION
AE_431 THEY BELIEVED THAT THROUGH ME THEY POSSESSED THE PHILOSOPHERS STONE THE UNIVERSAL PANACEA THE INTERCOURSE WITH ALL THE ELEMENTARY HEAVENLY AND INFERNAL SPIRITS AND THEY HAD NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT THANKS TO MY SUBLIME SCIENCE THEY COULD FIND OUT THE SECRETS OF EVERY GOVERNMENT IN EUROPE
AE_432 BUT ALTHOUGH BELIEVING FULLY IN MY ORACLES THEY WERE TOO KIND HEARTED TO THINK THEM THE WORK OF THE DOUBLE AND IT SUITED THEIR NATURAL GOODNESS BETTER TO BELIEVE MY ANSWERS INSPIRED BY SOME HEAVENLY SPIRIT
AE_433 THERE WERE NOT ONLY GOOD CHRISTIANS AND FAITHFUL TO THE CHURCH BUT EVEN REAL DEVOTEES AND FULL OF SCRUPLES
AE_434 BESIDES I FOUND IT VERY FLATTERING TO MY VANITY TO BECOME THE SUBJECT OF THE SPECALIVERCHATTERING OF EMPTY FOOLS WHO HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO DO AND ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE OF EVERY MORAL PHENOMENON THEY MAKE WITH WHICH THOUNARROWINTELLECTCANNOTUNDERS
AE_435 YOUR APARTMENT IS READY YOU MAY SEND YOUR CLOTHES YOU SHALL HAVE A SERVANT A GONDOLA AT YOUR ORDERS MY OWN TABLE AND TEN SEQUINS A MONTH
AE_436 I THREW MYSELF AT HIS FEET TO ASSURE HIM OF MY GRATITUDE AND EMBRACED HIM CALLING HIM MY FATHER
AE_437 SIR EDWARD NOT WHOLLY DISCOURAGED BY THE DENIAL WITH WHICH NORA FOR HAD WITH DELICACY ACQUAINTED HIM STILL HOPED FOR A KIND RECEPTION AND WAS SO OFTEN AT THE HOUSE OF MISSUS HORTON THAT LORD FREDERICKS JEALOUSY WAS EXCITED AND THE TORTURES HE SUFFERED IN CONSEQUENCE CONVINCED HIM BEYOND A DOUBT OF THE SINCERITY OF HIS AFFECTION
AE_439 YET DID THE WATCHFUL MISS WOODLEY OFTENTIMES HEAR A SIGH ESCAPE FROM HER UNKNOWN TO HERSELF TILL SHE WAS REMINDED OF IT AND THEN A SUDDEN BLUSH WOULD INSTANTLY OVERSPREAD HER FACE
AE_43 A YELLOW VARIETY CALLED GOLDEN MILLET IS SOLD IN THE GROCERS SHOPS FOR MAKING PUDDINGS AND IS VERY DELICATE AND WHOLESOME
AE_440 I HOPE MISS MILNER YOU PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME
AE_441 YES INDEED AND I BELIEVE IT IS RIGHT THAT I SHOULD KEEP MY FIRST PROMISE IS IT NOT
AE_443 NOR HAD THIS GOOD WOMANS OFFICIOUS LABOURS TAKEN THE LEAST FROM THE AWKWARDNESS OF THE SILENCE WHICH AS SOON AS THE BUSTLE SHE HAD MADE WAS OVER RETURNED IN ITS FULL FORCE
AE_444 HER HAND FELL MOTIONLESS FROM THAT WHICH SHE HELD SHE APPEARED MOTIONLESS HERSELF TILL MISSUS HORTON BESEECHING HER NOT TO BE UNEASY AT THE TREATMENT SHE HAD RECEIVED MADE HER TEARS FLOW AS IF HER HEART WAS BREAKING
AE_445 IT WAS NOT FROM ANY REAL CAUSE OF GRIEF THAT SHE WEPT BUT THERE WAS A MAGNETIC QUALITY IN TEARS WHICH ALWAYS ATTRACTED HERS
AE_446 IF YOU THINK SO MADAM I SEE NOTHING THAT SHOULD PREVENT ME NOW
AE_447 NIECE I COMMAND YOU NOT TO STIR OUT OF THE ROOM THIS EVENING
AE_448 MISS WOODLEY OBEDIENTLY SAT DOWN AND THOUGH HER THOUGHTS AND HEART WERE IN THE CHAMBER OF HER FRIEND SHE NEVER MARKED BY ONE IMPERTINENT WORD OR BY ONE LINE OF HER FACE THE RESTRAINT SHE SUFFERED
AE_449 MISS WOODLEY THOUGHT IT HER DUTY TO BE MUTE AND NOW THE GINGLE OF A TEA SPOON WAS LIKE A DEEP TONED BELL ALL WAS SO QUIET
AE_44 ANOTHER ADVANTAGE THE RED WHEATS POSSESS IS THEIR COMPARATIVE IMMUNITY FROM THE ATTACKS OF MILDEW AND FLY
AE_450 MISSUS HORTON TOO IN THE SELF APPROVING REFLECTION THAT SHE WAS NOT IN A QUARREL OR ALTERCATION OF ANY KIND FELT HERSELF AT THIS MOMENT REMARKABLY PEACEFUL AND CHARITABLE
AE_451 MISS WOODLEY DID NOT RECOLLECT HERSELF SO BUT WAS SO IN REALITY IN HER PEACE AND CHARITY WERE INSTINCTIVE VIRTUES ACCIDENT COULD NOT INCREASE THEM
AE_452 DORA FORTH READ ON AND SEEMED AFRAID OF LOOKING UP LEST HE SHOULD SEE WHAT HE COULD NOT HAVE PARDONED
AE_453 AFTER A FEW MINUTES PAUSE AND SOME LITTLE EMBARRASSMENT ON THE PART OF MISSUS HORTON AT THE DISAPPOINTMENT SHE HAD TO ENCOUNTER FROM THIS UNEXPECTED DUTIFUL CONDUCT SHE ASKED MISS MILNER IF SHE WOULD NOW HAVE ANY TEA
AE_454 DORRIFORTH THEN LAID THE BOOK OUT OF HIS HAND AND BY THE TIME THE SERVANT HAD LEFT THE ROOM THUS BEGAN
AE_455 IT IS OFTEN THE UNGRATEFUL TASK OF A FRIEND TO BE TROUBLESOME SOMETIMES UNMANNERLY
AE_456 WHAT HE SAID HE LOOKED WITH SO MUCH SINCERITY THAT HAD SHE BEEN BURNING WITH RAGE AT HIS LATE BEHAVIOUR SHE MUST HAVE FORGIVEN HIM FOR THE REGRET WHICH HE SO FORCIBLY EXPRESSED
AE_458 KEEP YOUR APPOINTMENT AND BE ASSURED THAT I SHALL ISSUE MY COMMANDS WITH MORE CIRCUMSPECTION FOR THE FUTURE AS I FIND HOW STRICTLY THEY ARE COMPLIED WITH
AE_460 AND NOW IT HAD COME TO PASS THAT HIS SOLE REMAINING ALLY MISTER SAMUEL BOZZLE THE EX POLICEMAN WAS BECOMING WEARY OF HIS
AE_461 AT LAST HE SENT WORD TO SAY THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD BE IN ENGLAND BEFORE THE END OF MARCH AND WOULD SEE THAT THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW SHOULD BE VINDICATED IN HIS FAVOUR
AE_462 IN MAKING THIS HE HAD EXPECTED NO SUCCESS THOUGH FROM THE ENERGETIC NATURE OF HIS DISPOSITION HE HAD MADE THE ATTEMPT WITH SOME ZEAL
AE_463 AND HAD THE CASE BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE JUDGE ORDINARY BY MEANS OF HER HUSBANDS EXERTIONS SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLEASURE IN READING EVERY WORD OF THE EVIDENCE EVEN THOUGH HER HUSBAND SHOULD HAVE BEEN EVER SO ROUGHLY HANDLED BY THE LAWYERS
AE_464 OF COURSE IT AINT SAID MISSUS BOZZLE
AE_465 THE PATERNAL PARENT HAS A RIGHT TO HIS INFANTS NO DOUBT THAT WAS BOZZLES LAW
AE_466 ILL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS B EXCLAIMED MISSUS BOZZLE ITS MY BELIEF AS HE AINT QUITE RIGHT UP HERE AND MISSUS BOZZLE TOUCHED HER FOREHEAD
AE_467 ITS THAT AS MAKES EM I WONT SAY WHAT
AE_468 TRIVALION HAD FOLLOWED HIS LETTER QUICKER THAN HE HAD INTENDED WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN AND WAS NOW WITH HIS PRIME MINISTER BEFORE HIS PRIME MINISTER HAD BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ANY ACTION ON THE LAST INSTRUCTION RECEIVED
AE_469 DOES ONE MISTER SAMUEL AS I LIVE HERE ASKED RVALION
AE_46 OR LET THE TARTARIC ACID AND SALT BE REDUCED TO THE FINEST POSSIBLE POWDER THEN MIX THEM WELL WITH THE FLOWER
AE_470 BOZZLE HAD ALWAYS WAITED UPON HIM WITH A DECENT COAT AND A WELL BRUSHED HAT AND CLEAN SHOES
AE_471 IT IS VERY MUCH EASIER FOR SUCH MEN AS MISTER BOZZLE TO CARRY DECENCY OF APPEARANCE ABOUT WITH THEM THAN TO KEEP IT AT HOME
AE_472 AS HE WENT ABOUT HIS EYES WERE EVER CAST DOWNWARDS AND HE WALKED WITH A QUICK SHUFFLING GAIT AND HE SUSPECTED OTHERS FEELING THAT HE HIMSELF WAS SUSPECTED
AE_473 IVE WATCHED AS SHARP AS WATCHING CAN GO PRETTY NEAR
AE_474 AND HE DID GO AWAY LEAVING BOSSLESSTANDINGIN THE MIDDLE OF STONY WALK
AE_476 WHO WAS TOUCHING ME AND UNTRUSSING ME
AE_477 TOSENEAISPERISHINGTHOUARTLIVINGONREGARDLESS I AM DYING OF HOPE DEFERRED THEREFORE UNTRUSS THYSELF WITH A GOOD WILL FOR MINE IT IS HERE IN THIS RETIRED SPOT TO GIVE THEE AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND LASHES

AE_479 DOST THOU REVOLT AGAINST THY MASTER AND THATTURALLORD
AE_47 SOUR MILK OR BUTTERMILK MAY BE USED BUT THEN A LITTLE LESS ACID WILL BE NEEDED
AE_480 DO QUIXOTE GAVE HIS PROMISE AND SWORE BY THE LIFE OF HIS THOUGHTS NOT TO TOUCH SO MUCH AS A HAIR OF HIS GARMENTS AND TO LEAVE HIM ENTIRELY FREE AND TO HIS OWN DISCRETION TO WHIP HIMSELF WHENEVER HE PLEASED
AE_481 SANCHO ROSE AND REMOVED SOME DISTANCE FROM THE SPOT BUT AS HE WAS ABOUT TO PLACE HIMSELF LEANING AGAINST ANOTHER TREE HE FELT SOMETHING TOUCH HIS HEAD AND PUTTING UP HIS HANDS ENCOUNTERED SOMEBODYS TWO FEET WITH SHOES AND STOCKINGS ON THEM
AE_482 HE WAS MOUNTED UPON A POWERFUL HORSE AND HAD ON A COAT OF MAIL WITH FOUR OF THE PISTOLS THEY CALL PETRONELS IN THAT COUNTRY AT HIS WAIST
AE_483 IN A WORD HE PLEDGED HIMSELF TO BE MINE AND I PROMISED TO BE HIS WITHOUT CARRYING MATTERS ANY FURTHER
AE_484 GIVE ME MY HORSE AND ARMS AND WAIT FOR ME HERE I WILL GO IN QUEST OF THIS KNIGHT AND DEAD OR ALIVE I WILL MAKE HIM KEEP HIS WORD PLIGHTED TO SO GREAT BEAUTY
AE_485 THEY MADE HASTE TO OVERTAKE THEM WHICH AS THE PARTY MOVED SLOWLY THEY WERE ABLE TO DO WITH EASE
AE_486 O HUSBAND WHOSE UNHAPPY FATE IN BEING MINE HATH BORNE THEE FROM THE BERIAGETBETEDTOTHEGRAVE
AE_487 THE SERVANTS WEPT CLOUDY IS SWOONED AWAY AGAIN AND AGAIN AND THE WHOLE PLACE SEEMED A FIELD OF SORROW AND AN ABODE OF MISFORTUNE
AE_489 SANCHO SAID THEY HAD BUT THAT THREE KERCHIEFS THAT WERE WORTH THREE CITIES WERE MISSING
AE_48 EXCELLENT ROLLS
AE_490 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE MAN
AE_491 SAID ONE OF THE BYSTANDERS I HAVE GOT THEM AND THEY ARE NOT WORTH THREE REALS
AE_492 WHAT LED ME INTO IT WAS A CERTAIN THIRST FOR VENGEANCE WHICH IS STRONG ENOUGH TO DISTURB THE QUIETEST HEARTS
AE_494 AND NOW THE SQUIRES DESPATCHED TO MAKE THE PRIZE CAME UP BRINGING WITH THEM TWO GENTLEMEN ON HORSEBACK TWO PILGRIMS ON FOOT AND A COACH FULL OF WOMEN WITH SOME SIX SERVANTS ON FOOT AND ON HORSEBACK IN ATTENDANCE ON THEM AND A COUPLE OF MULETEERS WHOM THE GENTLEMEN HAD WITH THEM
AE_495 THE REGENTS LADY ORDERED ONE OF HER SERVANTS TO GIVE THE EIGHTY CROWNS THAT HAD BEEN ASSESSED AS HER SHARE AT ONCE FOR THE CAPTAINS HAD ALREADY PAID DOWN THEIR SIXTY
AE_496 ONE OF THE SQUIRES OBSERVED IN HIS MIXTURE OF GASCON AND CATALAN THIS CAPTAIN OF OURS WOULD MAKE A BETTER FRIAR THAN HIGHWAYMAN IF HE WANTS TO BE SO GENEROUS ANOTHER TIME LET IT BE WITH HIS OWN PROPERTY AND NOT OURS
AE_497 THEY WERE ALL TAKEN ABACK AND NOT ONE OF THEM DARED TO UTTER A WORD SUCH DEFERENCE DID THEY PAY HIM
AE_498 HE HAD BEEN A CLERK IN A BANKING HOUSE AND WAS TRANSPORTED FOR EMBEZZLEMENT THOUGH BY SOME GRAVE DOUBTS AS TO HIS GUILT WERE ENTERTAINED
AE_499 WHEN THE MUSTRABELLRANG AND THE GANG BROKE UP RUFUS DAWES ON HIS SILENT WAY TO HIS SEPARATE CELL OBSERVED A NOTABLE CHANGE OF CUSTOM IN THE DISPOSITION OF THE NEW CONVICT
AE_49 SEVENTEEN TWENTY FOUR
AE_4 I COULD NOT TAKE MY EYES OFF THE MAN IN THE BED
AE_501 A PRISONER REFRACTORY YOUR REVERENCE SAID THE WATCHMAN
AE_502 WANTS TO COME OUT MISTER NORTH
AE_503 I ORDER YOU SIR NORTH CRIED INDIGNANT

AE_507 IMPERTINENT YOUNG BEGGAR SAID BURGESS
AE_508 DO HIM GOOD CURSE HIM
AE_509 ITS HARD FOR SUCH YOUNG UNS
AE_50 TO MAKE DRY TOAST
AE_510 HE HAD HARDLY UTTERED THE WORDS WHEN THE BOY FLUNG HIMSELF BENEATH THE LOG
AE_511 HOW LONG TO ME MISS NANCY SAID THE GIANT IM BIG ENOUGH TO CARRY DOUBLE
AE_512 JUST AS HE REACHED IT HOWEVER THE FIGURE OF MISTER NORTH ROSE FROM BEHIND A PILE OF STONES
AE_513 MUST STOP THAT FIFTY LASHES TROKE
AE_514 AT LAST FELLOW YOU HAD OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN TIED UP HIMSELF

AE_518 AND THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH HE IS WITH US
AE_519 YOU HAVE NOT BEEN LONG IN THE COLONY MISTER MEEKIN
AE_51 NEVER USE NEW BREAD FOR MAKING ANY KIND OF TOAST AS IT EATS HEAVY AND BESIDES IS VERY EXTRAVAGANT
AE_520 IF YOU PLEASE SAID MEEKIN GRAVELY
AE_521 PRAY HELP YOURSELF TO WINE
AE_522 SO HE IS A FRIEND OF YOURS ANY
AE_523 I HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING HIM IN SOCIETY
AE_524 THE DEVIL HE IS I HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT IT TOO
AE_525 IN FACT THE RINGLEADER JOHN REX GAVE ME HIS CONFESSION AND I SENT IT TO THE BISHOP
AE_526 A GREAT RASCAL PUT IN NORTH
AE_527 WELL NOW SAID MEEKIN WITH ASPERITY I DONT AGREE WITH YOU
AE_528 HE SEEMS TO ME TO BE TRULY PENITENT FOR HIS OFFENCES A MISGUIDED BUT NOT A HYPOCRITICAL MAN IF MY KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE GOES FOR ANYTHING I HOPE HE IS SAID NORTH
AE_529 THERE IS NO FEAR OF HIM SAID BURGESS CHEERILY IF HE GROWS UPROARIOUS WELL SOON GIVE HIM A TOUCH OF THE CAT
AE_52 TO MAKE HOT BUTTERED TOAST SEVENTEEN TWENTY SIX
AE_530 SO THEY WENT ON TO THE VERANDAH AND LOOKED DOWN UPON THE LIGHTS OF THE PRISON AND LISTENED TO THE SEA LAPPING THE SHORE
AE_531 BY AND BY A SHORT FIGURE SMOKING A CHEROOT CAME UP OUT OF THE DARK AND PROVED TO BE DOCTOR MACKAWANEWHOHADBEENOPREVENTED FROM ATTENDING THE DINNER BY REASON OF AN ACCIDENT TO A CONSTABLE AGNORFOTBAYSWHICH HAD CLAIMED HIS PROFESSIONAL ATTENTION
AE_532 DEAD SAID DOCTOR MACCAWANE

AE_535 WHO IS HE GOING TO FLOG NOW

AE_537 PERHAPS YOULL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO ALLOW ME TO BE THE BEST JUDGE OF THAT RETURNED MACAWANEDRAWINGUP HIS LITTLE BODY TO ITS LEAST INSIGNIFICANT STATURE
AE_538 HE SLEEPS AT THE BACK AND NORTH HURRIED OFF

AE_540 MACKLEWAIN SHOOK HIS HEAD SERIOUSLY

AE_545 DAMMYERIMPERTINENTSIRBURSTOUTBURGESS
AE_546 NORTH KNEW WELL THAT HE WOULD NEVER DARE TO ATTEMPT ANY SUCH ACT OF VIOLENCE BUT THE INSULT STUNG HIM LIKE THE CUT OF A WHIP
AE_547 SO MISTER NORTH OUT HE SAID AND GO DOWN TO THE BARRACKS AND TELL TROKE THAT CROKLINISTOTHAVEAHUNDREDLASHESTOMORROW
AE_548 THE GOVERNMENT MAY GO TO AND YOU TOO ROARED BERGIS GET OUT
AE_549 ILL REPORT THIS TO THE GOVERNMENT
AE_54 HE SAYS THAT BY CUTTING THROUGH FOUR OR FIVE SLICES AT A TIME ALL THE BUTTER IS SQUEEZED OUT OF THE UPPER ONES WHILE THE BOTTOM ONE IS SWIMMING IN FAT LIQUID
AE_550 I WISH I HADNT TAKEN THAT BRANDY HE SAID FOOL THAT I AM
AE_551 THE LORD LOOKED DOWN UPON ME
AE_552 HE MIXED A TEASPOON OF THIS IN A PANIC AND OF WATER AND DRANK IT
AE_553 IT WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD REACHED THE CRISIS OF A DISEASE WHICH HAD BEEN FOR DAYS GATHERING FORCE
AE_554 TWICE HE PAUSED ON THE WAY TO THE SITTING ROOM AND TWICE WAS HE DRIVEN ON BY A POWER STRONGER THAN HIS WILL
AE_555 THAT AT ALL TIMES DEBASING AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME IT WAS INFAMOUS THAT A VICE UNWORTHY OF ANY MAN WAS DOUBLY SINFUL IN A MAN OF EDUCATION AND A MINISTER OF GOD IN VAIN
AE_556 HER MEETING WITH LETTY WAS INDESCRIBABLY TENDER AND THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED WERE PRETTY EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN HER AND HER BROTHER IN NURSING THE ONE AND LOVING THE OTHER
AE_557 NOTHING CAN SURPRISE ME NOW IM PREPARED FOR ANY THING EVEN THE SIGHT OF MY QUAKERISH LOVER DANCING A JACK
AE_558 I FEEL LIKE A BOY OUT OF SCHOOL OR RATHER A MAN OUT OF PRISON AND MUST ENJOY MY LIBERTY IN SOME WAY

AE_562 TO NO HOME IN THE LAND DID THE GREAT TROUBLE BRING A MORE SUDDEN CHANGE THAN THE LITTLE COTTAGE IN THE LANE
AE_564 DAVID HELD IT CLOSE IN BOTH OF HIS SAYING GRATEFULLY THANK YOU MOTHER THEN FIXING HIS EYES ON THE YOUNGER YET NOT DEARER WOMEN HE ADDED WITH A RING IN HIS VOICE THAT MADE THEIR HEARTS ANSWER WITH A PROMPT AY AY IN SPITE OF LOVE OR FEAR
AE_565 THE BOYS BLESS THEIR BRAVE HEARTS HAVE DONE NOBLY BUT OLDER MEN ARE NEEDED NOW WE CANNOT SACRIFICE ALL THE GALLANT LADS AND WE WHO HAVE MORE TO LOSE THAN THEY MUST TAKE OUR TURN AND TRY TO DO AS WELL
AE_566 YES DAVID SISTER AND SWEETHEART ANSWERED BRAVELY FORGETTING IN THE FOUR OF THE MOMENT WHAT HEAVY CONSEQUENCES GOD MIGHT SEE FIT TO SEND GOOD
AE_567 THEN IT WILL TAKE THE GARDEN IN THE GREEN HOUSE OFF MY HANDS THIS AT HIM FOR A YEAR OR LONGER IF I LIKE

AE_570 IF SOMETHING TO TELL ME I SEE IT IN YOUR FACE DEAR I MUST GO
AE_571 THE LOYAL FRENZY FELL UPON THE THREE QUIET WOMEN AND THEY COULD NOT DO TOO MUCH FOR THEIR COUNTRY
AE_572 IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN MANY NAPSAXTOHOLDIDWEGESTSHOWERED UPON HIM BY HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS
AE_573 FINDING THAT LISHA SHOWED THE LITTLE ENTHUSIASM ON THE SUBJECT SHE TRIED TO ROUSE HIM BY PATRIOTIC APPEALS OF VARIOUS SORTS

AE_578 NOW LETS BE BRAVE AND ENJOY EVERY MINUTE OF IT
AE_579 NOT ONE DAY OF IT THATS TRUE LOVE CHRISTIE
AE_580 DAVID CAUGHT THE EXALTATION AND GAVE NO FURTHER THOUGHT TO ANY THING BUT THE DUTY OF THE HOUR FINDING HIMSELF STRONGER AND BRAVER FOR THAT LONG LOOK INTO THE ILLUMINATED FACE OF THE WOMAN HE LOVED
AE_581 THE ROSES ARE FOR THEY REMIND ME OF POOR HELEN AND THE FIRST WORK I DID WITH DAVID WAS ARRANGING FLOWERS LIKE THESE FOR A DEAD BABYS LITTLE COFFIN

AE_620 THESE INTRUDERS ARE VERY PECULIAR PEOPLE REMARKED A MAN IN THE CROWD
AE_621 THEY SEEM VERY IGNORANT POOR THINGS SAID ANOTHER IN REPLY
AE_622 SO THEY FOLLOWED HER THROUGH THE LOW ARCHWAY AND IN A ROOM BEYOND VERY SIMPLY FURNISHED SAT A YOUNG GIRL ENGAGED IN DARNING A PAIR OF PINK STOCKINGS
AE_624 WHAT IS IT QUARELYSHEASKEDTHEWOMAN
AE_625 ARE YOU A GIANT
AE_626 PERHAPS YOU ARE TRYING TO RIDDACILLMESHECONTINUEDSREGARDINGAZALER'SFACECLOSELY
AE_627 THERE IS NOTHING MAJESTIC ABOUT ME AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL
AE_628 EVEN IN AMERICA EVERBODY BOWS LOAD OUR PRESIDENT AN THE BLUESKINS ARE SO FRAID O THEIR BOOLOOROO THAT THEY TREMBLE WHENEVER THEY GO NEAR HIM
AE_629 BUT SURELY THAT IS ALL WRONG SAID TORMELLINGRAVELY
AE_630 THEREFORE I AM A MERE AGENT TO DIRECT THE LAWS WHICH ARE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND AM ONLY A PUBLIC SERVANT OBLIGED CONSTANTLY TO GUARD THE WELFARE OF MY SUBJECTS
AE_631 IN THAT CASE SAID BUTTON BRIGHT YOURE ENTITLED TO THE BEST THERE IS TO PAY FOR YOUR TROUBLE
AE_633 I HAVE ONE GREAT PRIVILEGE
AE_634 AFTER MY DEATH THE PINK MARBLE STATUE OF ME WILL BE SET UP IN THE GRAND COURT WITH THE STATUES OF THE OTHER KINGS AND QUEENS WHO HAVE RULED THIS LAND AND ALL THE PINKIES IN AGES TO COME WILL THEN HONOR ME AS HAVING BEEN A JUST AND UPRIGHT QUEEN THAT IS MY REWARD
AE_635 A MISFORTUNE AT BIRTH PLACED ME HERE AND I CANNOT ESCAPE MY FATE
AE_636 IT IS MUCH MORE DESIRABLE TO BE A PRIVATE CITIZEN HAPPY AND CARE FREE
AE_637 YOU ARE NOT LIKE MY PEOPLE THE PINKIES AND THERE IS NO PLACE FOR YOU IN OUR COUNTRY
AE_638 ILL LOOK IN THE GREAT BOOK FIRST
AE_63 SEVENTEEN THIRTY FOUR
AE_640 IT WAS SILENT BECAUSE ALL SPEECH IS OF NECESSITY FEEBLE AND IMPERFECT THEREFORE THE SOULS OF MY ANCESTORS ASCEND TO GOD IN WORDLESS ADORATION
AE_641 NONE MIGHT EXHORT OR CONFESS OR IN ANY WAY MEDDLE WITH THE RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE OF ANOTHER
AE_642 AMONG US ALL MEN WERE CREATED SONS OF GOD AND STOOD ERECT AS CONSCIOUS OF THEIR DIVINITY
AE_643 KNOWING THAT GOD SETS NO VALUE UPON MATERIAL THINGS HE TOOK WITH HIM NO OFFERINGS OR SACRIFICES OTHER THAN SYMBOLIC OBJECTS SUCH AS PAINTS AND TOBACCO
AE_644 AT THE SOLEMN HOUR OF SUNROSERSONSSADHETOOKUPHISPOSITIONOVERLOOKINGTHEGLORIESOFEARTHAND FACING THE GREAT MYSTERY AND THERE HE REMAINED NAKED ERECT SILENT AND MOTIONLESS EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS AND FORCES OF HIS ARMING FOR A NIGHT AND A DAY TO TWO DAYS AND NIGHTS BUT RARELY LONGER
AE_645 IT WAS NOT THEN WHOLLY FROM IGNORANCE OR IMPROVIDENCE THAT HE FAILED TO ESTABLISH PERMANENT TOWNS AND TO DEVELOP A MATERIAL CIVILIZATION
AE_646 TO THE UNTUTORED SAGE THE CONCENTRATION OF POPULATION WAS THE PROLIFIC MOTHER OF ALL EVILS MORAL NO LESS THAN PHYSICAL
AE_647 IN THIS TYPE OF PRAYER THERE WAS NO BESEECHING OF FAVOR OR HELP
AE_648 FROM THE SUN AS THE UNIVERSAL FATHER PROCEEDS THE QUICKENING PRINCIPLE IN NATURE AND IN THE PATIENT AND FRUITFUL WOMB OF OUR MOTHER THE EARTH ARE HIDDEN EMBRYOS OF PLANTS AND MEN
AE_649 WHO MAY CONDEMN HIS SUPERSTITION
AE_64 MODE PUT THE MILK AND BUTTER INTO A SAUCEPAN AND KEEP SHAKING IT ROUND UNTIL THE LATTER IS MELTED
AE_650 HERE IS THE SUPREME MYSTERY THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF WORSHIP WITHOUT WHICH THERE CAN BE NO RELIGION AND IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS MYSTERY OUR ATTITUDE CANNOT BE VERY UNLIKE THAT OF THE NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WHO BEHOLDS WITH AWE THE DIVINE IN ALL CREATION
AE_651 IN HIS OWN THOUGHT HE ROSE SUPERIOR TO THEM HE SCORNED THEM EVEN AS A LOFTY SPIRIT ABSORBED IN ITS STERN TASK REJECTS THE SOFT BEDS THE LUXURIOUS FOOD THE PLEASURE WORSHIPING GALLONS OF THE RICH NEIGHBOUR
AE_652 THE HISTORIANS OF THE WHITE RACE ADMIT THAT THE INDIAN WAS NEVER THE FIRST TO REPUDIATE HIS OATH
AE_653 HER ATTITUDE AND SECRET MEDITATIONS MUST BE SUCH AS TO INSTILL INTO THE RECEPTIVE SOUL OF THE UNBORN CHILD THE LOVE OF THE GREAT MYSTERY AND A SENSE OF BROTHERHOOD WITH ALL CREATION
AE_654 THIS WILD MOTHER HAS NOT ONLY THE EXPERIENCE OF HER MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND THE ACCEPTED RULES OF HER PEOPLE FOR A GUIDE BUT SHE HUMBLY SEEKS TO LEARN A LESSON FROM ANTS BEES SPIDERS BEAVERS AND BADGERS
AE_655 INDEED THE DISTINCTIVE WORK OF BOTH GRANDPARENTS IS THAT OF ACQUAINTING THE YOUTH WITH THE NATIONAL TRADITIONS AND BELIEFS
AE_656 THE FAMILY WAS NOT ONLY THE SOCIAL UNIT BUT ALSO THE UNIT OF GOVERNMENT
AE_657 THE REMOTERDEGREESOFKINSHIPWEREFULLYRECOGNIZEDANDTHATNOTASAMATTEROFORMONLYFIRSTPEASANTS WERE KNOWN AS BROTHERS AND SISTERS THE NAME OF COUSIN CONSTITUTED A BINDING CLAIM AND OUR RIGID MORALITY FORBADE MARRIAGE BETWEEN COUSINS IN ANY KNOWN DEGREE OR IN OTHER WORDS WITHIN THE CLAN
AE_658 WHEN SHE FELL THE WHOLE RACE FELL WITH HER
AE_659 HIS DAILY DEVOTIONS WERE MORE NECESSARY TO HIM THAN DAILY FOOD
AE_65 THE NARRATIVE IT MAY BE IS WOVEN OF SO HUMBLE A TEXTURE AS TO REQUIRE THIS ADVANTAGE AND AT THE SAME TIME TO RENDER IT THE MORE DIFFICULT OF ATTAINMENT
AE_660 HE CUTS OFF THE CHOICEST MORSEL OF THE MEAT AND CASTS IT INTO THE FIRE THE PUREST AND MOST ETHEREAL ELEMENT
AE_661 THE HOSPITALITY OF THE WHITONISONLYLIMITED BY THE INSTITUTION OF WAR
AE_662 OUR HONOR IS THE GUARANTEE FOR HIS SAFETY SO LONG AS HE IS WITHIN THE CAMP
AE_663 LOVE BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN HAS FOUND IT ON THE MATING INSTINCT AND IS NOT FREE FROM DESIRE AND SELF SEEKING
AE_664 BUT TO HAVE A FRIEND AND TO BE TRUE UNDER ANY AND ALL TRIALS IS THE MARK OF A MAN
AE_665 REINCARNATION IN THE CONGRESS OF SPIRITS
AE_666 THEREFORE HE COURTS DEATH IN BATTLE ON THE OTHER HAND HE WOULD REGARD IT AS DISGRACEFUL TO BE KILLED IN A PRIVATE QUARREL
AE_667 IT WAS PREPARED BY DRESSING IN THE FINEST CLOTHES TOGETHER WITH SOME PERSONAL POSSESSIONS AND ORNAMENTS WRAPPED IN SEVERAL ROBES AND FINALLY IN A CENT PURE COVERING A RIDE
AE_669 IF A MAN WERE SLAIN IN BATTLE IT WAS AN OLD CUSTOM TO PLACE HIS BODY AGAINST A TREE OR ROCK IN A SITTING POSITION ALWAYS FACING THE ENEMY TO INDICATE HIS UNDAUNTED DEFIANCE AND BRAVERY EVEN IN DEATH
AE_670 AT EVERY MEAL TIME A DISH OF FOOD WAS PLACED UNDER IT AND SOME PERSON OF THE SAME SEX AND AGE AS THE ONE WHO WAS GONE MUST AFTERWARD BE INVITED IN TO PARTAKE OF THE FOOD
AE_671 IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE AMERICAN INDIAN HAD SOMEHOW DEVELOPED A COLD POWER AND ALTHOUGH IN THE LATTER DAYS THERE HAVE BEEN MANY IMPOSTORS AND ALLOWING FOR THE VANITY AND WEAKNESS OF HUMAN NATURE IT IS FAIR TO ASSUME THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME EVEN IN THE OLD DAYS YET THERE ARE WELL ATTESTED INSTANCES OF REMARKABLE PROPHECIES AND OTHER MYSTIC PRACTICE
AE_672 THIS WAS ONLY ONE OF HIS REMARKABLE PROPHECIES
AE_673 ANOTHER FAMOUS MEDICINE MAN WAS BORN ON THE RUM RIVER ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO AND LIVED TO BE OVER A CENTURY OLD
AE_674 AT THE AGE OF ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE YEARS HE SAVED HIS BAND FROM UTTER DESTRUCTION AT THE HANDS OF THEIR ANCESTRAL ENEMIES BY SUDDENLY GIVING WARNING RECEIVED IN A DREAM OF THE APPROACH OF A LARGE WAR PARTY
AE_675 MANY OF THE INDIANS BELIEVED THAT ONE MAY BE BORN MORE THAN ONCE AND THERE WERE SOME WHO CLAIMED TO THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF A FORMER INCARNATION
AE_676 THERE WAS A WELL KNOWN TO WAR PROFITS WHO LIVED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY SO THAT HE IS STILL REMEMBERED BY THE OLD MAN WAS AND
AE_677 AS GLADDEN RODE BY A ACURRIERRODUPANDTOLDHIMSOMETHING
AE_678 WE WERE SUPPORTING AN ALABAMA BRIGADE
AE_679 THAT RIDE MY BRAVE FIRST TENNESSEE GIVE EM HAIL COLUMBIA
AE_680 THE FACT WAS KEPT FROM THE TROOPS
AE_681 WE HAD TO PASS OVER THE GROUND WHERE TROOPS HAD BEEN FIGHTING ALL DAY
AE_682 I HAD HEARD AND READ OF BATTLEFIELDS SEEN PICTURES OF BATTLEFIELDS OF HORSES AND MEN OF CANNON AND WAGONS ALL JUMBLED TOGETHER WHILE THE GROUND WAS STREWN WITH DEAD AND DYING AND WOUNDED BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT I NEVER REALIZED THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE THING CALLED GLORIOUS WAR UNTIL I SAW THIS
AE_683 I HAD BEEN FEELING MEAN ALL THE MORNING AS IF I HAD STOLEN A SHEEP BUT WHEN THEY WANTED TO CHARGE WAS GIVEN I GOT HAPPY
AE_684 ON MONDAY THE TIDE WAS REVERSED
AE_685 BUT AS I SAID BEFORE READER A PRIVATE SOLDIER IS BUT INOTTOMATONANDKNOWSNOTHING OF WHAT IS GOING ON AMONG THE GENERALS AND I AM ONLY GIVING THE CHRONICLES OF LITTLE THINGS AND EVENTS THAT CAME UNDER MY OWN OBSERVATION AS I SAW THEM THEN AND REMEMBER THEM NOW
AE_686 SHOULD YOU DESIRE TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE BATTLE I REFER YOU TO HISTORY
AE_687 A MONDAYMORNINGITOOACAPTUREDMEAMULE
AE_688 THE ROPE HOWEVER WAS STRONGER THAN THE MULES NO AND HE WAS FINALLY PREVAILED UPON BY THE STRENGTH OF THE ROPE TO CROSS THE CREEK
AE_689 WE REMAINED SEVERAL MONTHS BUT SOON WE WERE ON THE TRAMP AGAIN
AE_690 THE FEDERAL ARMY WAS CONCENTRATING AT NASHVILLE THERE WAS NO REST FOR THE WEARY
AE_691 FROM TIME TO TIME DIFFERENT REGIMENTS WERE SENT FORWARD TO DO PICKET DUTY
AE_692 I AM A VIDET YOU KNOW THE RESPONSIBILITY RESTING ON ME
AE_693 I SOON FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE RELIEF ON THE ROAD AND WAS AFRAID TO SHOOT I QUICKLY MADE UP MY MIND
AE_694 MY GUN WAS AT MY FEET AND ONE STEP WOULD GET IT
AE_695 I MADE A QUICK GLANCE OVER MY SHOULDER AND GRABBED AT MY GUN
AE_696 HE DIVINED MY MOTIVE AND FIRED THE BALL MISSED ITS AIM
AE_697 I THINK WE MUST HAVE KILLED A GOOD MANY IN THE OLD FIELD BECAUSE WE WERE FIRING ALL THE TIME AT THE SOLID LINE AS THEY ADVANCED UPON US
AE_698 LINE OF BATTLE WAS FORMED ON THE NORTH BANK OF STONES RIVER ON THE YANKEE SIDE
AE_699 BAD GENERALSHIP I THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS
AE_6 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE DESPISED HIM FOR BEING SO SIMPLE AND DOCILE
AE_700 THE PRIVATE COULD BUT HE WAS NO GENERAL YOU SEE
AE_701 I CAN LIEANDACOLONELFRIERSSON'SATTENTIONTO THE YANKEES AND HE REMARKED WELL I DONT KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE YANKEES OR NOT BUT IF THEY ARE THEY WILL COME OUT OF THEIR MIGHTY QUICK
AE_702 WE WERE ORDERED FORWARD TO THE ATTACK
AE_703 WE WERE RIGHT UPON THE YANKEE LINE ON THE WILKERSON TURN PIPE
AE_704 WE WERE NOT TWENTY YARDS OFF FROM THE YANKEES AND THEY WERE POURING THE HOT SHOT AND SHELLS RIGHT INTO OUR RANKS AND EVERY MAN WAS YELLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN
AE_705 PLAY COLOR BEARER OF THE FOURTH TENNESSEE REGIMENT RAN RIGHT UP IN THE MIDST OF THE ACULINE WITH HIS COLORS BEGGING HIS MEN TO FOLLOW
AE_706 THE LEADEN HAIL STORM SWEPT THEM OFF THE FIELD THEY FELL BACK AND RE FORMED
AE_707 WE WERE AT THAT TIME AT LEAST A HUNDRED YARDS IN ADVANCE OF THE BRIGADE CHEATHAM ALL THE TIME CALLING UPON THE MEN TO COME ON
AE_708 I SAW AND FELT THAT HE WAS NOT FIGHTING FOR GLORY BUT THAT HE WAS FIGHTING FOR HIS COUNTRY BECAUSE HE LOVED THAT COUNTRY AND HE WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIS LIFE FOR HIS COUNTRY AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR CAUSE
AE_709 AS I WENT BACK TO THE FIELD HOSPITAL I OVERTOOK ANOTHER MAN WALKING ALONG
AE_71 IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE RACE HAD DEGENERATED LIKE MANY A NOBLE RACE BESIDES IN CONSEQUENCE OF TOO STRICT A WATCHFULNESS TO KEEP IT PURE
AE_72 THESE FEATHERED PEOPLE HAD EXISTED TOO LONG IN THEIR DISTINCT VARIETY A FACT OF WHICH THE PRESENT REPRESENTATIVES JUDGING BY THE LUGUBRIOUSDEPORTMENTSEEMEDTOBEAWARE
AE_74 SO WISE AS WELL AS ANTIQUE WAS THEIR ASPECT AS TO GIVE COLOR TO THE IDEA NOT MERELY THAT THEY WERE THE DESCENDANTS OF A TIME HONORED RACE BUT THAT THEY HAD EXISTED IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY EVER SINCE THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES WAS FOUNDED AND WERE SOMEHOW MIXED UP WITH ITS DESTINY
AE_75 THEY HAVE KNOWN ME MUCH LONGER BUT NEVER HONOR ME WITH ANY FAMILIARITY THOUGH HARDLY A DAY PASSES WITHOUT MY BRINGING THEM FOOD
AE_761 BESIDES THE SMALL FRY THE SWALLOWERS OF SWORDS AND THE GRIMACE MAKERS REAL PERFORMANCES TOOK PLACE ON THE GREEN
AE_762 EVEN THIS COMEDIAN OF JAWS AND CLAWS WAS ECLIPSED IN SUCCESS
AE_763 THAT SUCCESS WAS PRODIGIOUS STILL IT REMAINED LOCAL
AE_764 THE GLORY OF GWYNPLAINE HAD NOT PASSED LONDON BRIDGE
AE_765 THESE WERE REMARKABLE TALENTS
AE_766 BESIDES THIS HE HARANGUED LIKE CICERO AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN SOLD HIS DRUGS ATTENDED SICKNESS AND EVEN HEALED THE SICK
AE_767 URSUS WAS SATISFIED WITH THE APPLAUSE OF SOUTHWARK BUT BY NO MEANS ASTONISHED
AE_768 AT EVERY PERFORMANCE THE YARD OF THE INN TRANSFORMED INTO A PIT WAS FILLED WITH A RAGGED AND ENTHUSIASTIC AUDIENCE
AE_769 THE EMPTYING OF TANKARDS DID NOT DECREASE THEIR SUCCESS
AE_76 AH BUT THESE HENS ANSWERED THE YOUNG MAN THESE HENS OF ARISTOCRATIC LINEAGE WOULD SCORN TO UNDERSTAND THE VULGAR LANGUAGE OF A BARN YARD FOWL
AE_770 THIS CONNISSIRWASSUDDENLYFASCINATEDANDHAD ADOPTED THE LAUGHING MAN
AE_772 WHICH CLOUDS SEEING THAT THERE WAS NO ROOF SOMETIMES WEPT OVER THE MASTERPIECE OF URSUS
AE_773 HIS ENTHUSIASM CAUSED URSUS TO REMARK THIS MAN AND GWYNPLAINE TO OBSERVE HIM
AE_774 THEY HAD A GREAT FRIEND IN THIS UNKNOWN VISITOR
AE_775 HE WOULD MAKE A FAMOUS SCOUNDREL
AE_776 AT THAT HOUR THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE FAIR GROUND EXCEPT PERHAPS SOME REELING DRUNKARD MAKING STAGGERING SHADOWS IN DARK CORNERS
AE_777 ON THE SECOND OF THE MONTH AT TWO IN THE MORNING OUR PRECIOUS CARGO OF LUGGAGE WAS TAKEN ON BOARD THE GOOD SHIP
AE_778 WELL AND HAVE WE A FAIR WIND
AE_779 THE FACT IS THE CASTLE IS MUCH LATER THAN THE TIME OF THE HEROIC PRINCE OF DENMARK
AE_77 IT IS LIKE A BANDAGE OVER ONES EYES TO COME INTO IT
AE_780 NO MISTER HARDWIGG SAID THE CAPTAIN NO FEAR OF THAT
AE_782 THE VOLGARYKEPTOFFTHECOASTSTEERINGTOTHE WESTWARD
AE_783 ON ALL SIDES WERE TO BE SEEN WHOLE SCHOOLS OF WHALES AND SHARKS
AE_784 NEARLY THE WHOLE POPULATION OF THE TOWN WAS ON FOOT TO SEE US LAND
AE_785 THE FACT WAS THAT SCARCELY ANY ONE OF THEM BUT EXPECTED SOME GOODS BY THE PERIODICAL VESSEL
AE_786 THE PROFESSOR KNEW WHOM HE HAD TO DEAL WITH
AE_787 THIS MIGHT A SCHOLAR SPOKE NO LANGUAGES SAVE ICELANDIC AND LATIN
AE_788 WHEN THEREFORE HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO ME IN THE LANGUAGE OF HORACE WE AT ONCE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER
AE_789 VERY LIKELY I MAY FIND THERE SOME MANUSCRIPTS FROM THE HAND OF SUCKNUSOME
AE_78 IF YOU WOULD PERMIT ME SAID THE ARTIST LOOKING AT PHOEBE I SHOULD LIKE TO TRY WHETHER THAT THE GAROTYPECANBRINGOUTDISAGREEABLETRAITS ON A PERFECTLY AMIABLE FACE
AE_790 THOUGH NOT VERY LARGE IT APPEARED NOT LIKELY TO BE FILLED FOR CENTURIES
AE_791 I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT THAT IN HIGH WINDS ITS RED TILES WERE BLOWN OUT TO THE GREAT A NOISE OF THE PASTOR IN CONGREGATION
AE_792 THANKS TO THE HEAT OF THESE RESIDENCES GRASS GROWS ON THE ROOF WHICH GRASS IS CAREFULLY CUT FOR HAY
AE_793 I SAW BUT FEW INHABITANTS DURING MY EXCURSION BUT I MET A CROWD ON THE BEACH DRYING SALTING AND LOADING CODFISH THE PRINCIPAL ARTICLE OF EXPORTATION
AE_794 HANSAREESTRORDINARYGUIDEWENTFIRSTWALKINGWITHASTEADYSRAPIDUNVARYINGSTEP
AE_795 OUR TWO HORSES WITH THE LUGGAGE FOLLOWED OF THEIR OWN ACCORD WITHOUT REQUIRING WHIP OR SPUR
AE_796 GEOGRAPHERS HAVE DIVIDED IT INTO FOUR PARTS AND WE HAD TO CROSS THE SOUTHWEST QUARTER WHICH IN THE VERNACULAR IS CALLED SUDVESTEFURDINGER
AE_797 THEY VERY RARELY SUCCEED IN A GOOD SHOW OF YELLOW
AE_798 A FEW STRAY COWS AND SHEEP WERE ONLY SEEN OCCASIONALLY
AE_799 LITTLE DID I EXPECT HOWEVER THE SPECTACLE WHICH AWAITED US WHEN WE REACHED THE PENINSULA OF SNEFFELS WHERE AGGLOMERATIONS OF NATURES RUINS FORM A KIND OF TERRIBLE CHAOS
AE_79 MOST OF MY LIKENESSES DO LOOK UNAMIABLE BUT THE VERY SUFFICIENT REASON I FANCY IS BECAUSE THE ORIGINALS ARE SO
AE_7 THE SICK MAN RAGED AND SHOOK HIS FIST
AE_800 IT CONSISTS SIMPLY OF A FEW HOUSES NOT WHAT IN ENGLAND OR GERMANY WE SHOULD CALL A HAMLET
AE_801 I TOOK OCCASION TO CONSULT THE MAP TO SEE WHERE GARDAR WAS TO BE FOUND
AE_802 BUT MY UNCLE WAS IN NO HUMOR TO WAIT
AE_803 AT LENGTH THE STURDY LITTLE PONY SPREADING OUT HIS LEGS IN A STIFF AND LUDICROUS ATTITUDE GOT FROM UNDER THE PROFESSORS LEGS AND LEFT HIM STANDING WITH BOTH FEET ON A SEPARATE STONE LIKE THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES
AE_804 HE SAYS TIDE REPLIED MY UNCLE TRANSLATING THE DANISH WORD FOR MY INFORMATION
AE_805 I THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED THE NECESSITY FOR WAITING BEFORE CROSSING THE FORD OR THAT MOMENT WHEN THE SEA AT ITS HIGHEST POINT IS IN A STATE OF SLACK WATER
AE_806 ACCUSTOMED AS I HAD BEEN TO THE STEAM FERRY BOATS OF THE ELBE I FOUND THE LONG OARS OF THE BOATMEN BUT SORRY MEANS OF LOCOMOTION
AE_807 BUT THIS POWER OF DISCERNMENT WAS DENIED THEM AND ONLY IN AFTER YEARS WITH THE LOVED ONES OF THEIR OWN FIRESIDES CLOSE ABOUT THEM WAS THE WHOLE PICTURE REVEALED
AE_808 WHILE THE ATTACK WAS SUCCESSFUL IN A WAY ITS MAIN PURPOSE FAILED
AE_809 A COUNTER ATTACK WAS MADE UPON WOONGA AND HE WAS DRIVEN DEEP INTO THE WILDERNESS WITH GREAT LOSS
AE_80 WHILE WE GIVE IT CREDIT ONLY FOR DEPICTING THE MEREST SURFACE IT ACTUALLY BRINGS OUT THE SECRET CHARACTER WITH A TRUTH THAT NO PAINTER WOULD EVER VENTURE UPON EVEN COULD HE DETECT IT

AE_824 THERE WAS LITTLE TIME TO LOSE IN MAKING PREPARATIONS AND THE FOURTH DAY FOLLOWING THE RECEIPT OF LABEY'S LETTER FOUND ROD AND HIS MOTHER WAITING FOR THE TRAIN WHICH WAS TO WHIRL THE BOY INTO HIS NEW LIFE
AE_825 CHAPTER SEVEN THE HOME COMING
AE_826 CORNOLIONITISTELBHATREGARDED THE WHITE FLAG WITH FEELINGS IN WHICH TRIUMPH AND SADNESS WERE MINGLED STRANGELY
AE_827 BUT THE EMOTIONS OF HARRY AND HIS COMRADES WERE FOR THE MOMENT THOSE OF VICTORY ONLY
AE_828 THAT WHITE FLAG AND THOSE BOATS GOING OUT MEAN THAT SUMTER IS OURS
AE_829 BUT THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE SOON COMPLETED
AE_82 HE EXHIBITED AT THE GAROTYTEMINIATURE IN A MOROCCO CASE
AE_830 ALL THE AMENITIES WERE PRESERVED BETWEEN THE CAPTURED GARRISON AND THEIR CAPTORS
AE_831 THE GREAT STATE OF VIRGINIA MOTHER OF PRESIDENTS WENT OUT OF THE UNION AT LAST AND NORTH CAROLINA TENNESSEE AND ARKANSAS FOLLOWED HER BUT MARYLAND KENTUCKY AND MISSOURI STILL HUNG IN THE BALANCE
AE_832 THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE NOTE OF GLOOM
AE_833 EUROPE WHICH MUST HAVE ITS COTTON WHICH FAVOR THE SUCCESS OF THE SOUTH
AE_834 AN EXTRAORDINARY WAVE OF EMOTION SWEPT OVER THE SOUTH CARRYING EVERYBODY WITH IT
AE_835 WE NEED KENTUCKY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT A VERY LITTLE MORE MAY BRING THE STATE TO US GO WITH YOUR FATHER I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE BEEN A BRAVE YOUNG SOLDIER HERE AND MAY YOU DO AS WELL UP THERE
AE_836 HARRY GAVE HIS FAREWELLS WITH DEEP AND GENUINE REGRET
AE_837 WHETHER THEIR MANNER WAS GRAVE OR FRIVOLOUS HE KNEW THAT THESE WERE GOOD FRIENDS OF HIS AND HE SINCERELY HOPED THAT HE WOULD MEET THEM AGAIN
AE_838 FOUR MONTHS HAD MADE GREAT CHANGES HE BORE HIMSELF MORE LIKE A MAN HIS MANNER WAS MUCH MORE CONSIDERED AND GRAVE
AE_839 HE HAD SEEN GREAT THINGS AND HE HAD DONE HIS SHARE OF THEM
AE_83 HE HE MERELY GLANCED AT IT AND GAVE IT BACK
AE_840 HE GAZED UPON A WORLD FULL OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND PERILS
AE_841 BUT HE LOOKED BACK AT CHARLESTON THE GAY THE VALE ON THE BEAUTIFUL WITH REAL AFFECTION
AE_842 HE FELT THE DIFFERENCE AS SOON AS HE REACHED THE HILLS OF HIS NATIVE STATE
AE_843 PEOPLE WERE COOLER HERE AND THEY WERE MORE PRONE TO LOOK AT THE TWO SIDES OF A QUESTION
AE_844 THERE WERE NEVER BEFORE SUCH TIMES IN OLD KENTUCKY
AE_845 BILL SCALLIINHISGANGTHENMOUNTANERSWEREUP
AE_846 HE DID NOT SAY THE LAST AS A BOAST BUT MERELY AS AN ASSURANCE TO THE LIVERYMAN WHO HE SAW WAS ANXIOUS ON HIS ACCOUNT
AE_847 BUT HE SAW NOTHING THAT MOVED THERE NO SIGNAL LIGHTS TWINKLED
AE_848 WAS THERE EVER A HAPPIER MAN THAN JOSEPH THAT NIGHT AS HE STRODE ALONG THE FOOTPATH
AE_849 HE PRESSED HIS VIOLIN CASE TO HIS HEART AS IF IT WERE A LIVING THING THAT COULD KNOW THAT HE LOVED IT
AE_84 THE SUN AS YOU SEE TELLS QUITE ANOTHER STORY AND WILL NOT BE COAXED OUT OF IT AFTER HALF A DOZEN PATIENT ATTEMPTS ON MY PART
AE_850 BLESTAMIHERENOWMYGODANDBLESSEDSHALLIBETHERETHEN
AE_851 WHEN HE REACHED THE SUBURBS THE LIGHT OF HOMES WAS SHINING THROUGH CURTAINS OF ALL COLORS
AE_852 JUST THEN HE WAS IN NO MOOD TO THINK OF THE SORROWS
AE_853 LETTY FINDING HERSELF NOT QUITE EQUAL TO THE EMERGENCY CAME IN HER TURN TO CALL MARY SHE WENT AS QUIETLY AS IF SHE WERE LEAVING A TIRESOME VISITOR
AE_854 THE MUSIC WAS BROKEN AND JOSEPH LEFT ALONE WITH THE DUMB INSTRUMENTS
AE_855 BUT IN HIS HANDS SOLITUDE AND A VIOLIN WERE SURE TO MARRY IN MUSIC
AE_856 THEY SAT DOWN AND LISTENED IN SILENCE
AE_857 A LITTLE LONGER AND SHE WAS COMPELLED TO YIELD AND THE SILENT TEARS FLOWED FREELY
AE_859 NOR WAS THIS EXACTLY THE SHAPE THE THING TOOK TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE MUSICIAN
AE_85 AND YET IF YOU COULD ONLY SEE THE BENIGN SMILE OF THE ORIGINAL
AE_860 I LOVE THEE I LOVE THEE CRIED THE VIOLIN AND THE WORSHIP WAS ENTREATY THAT KNEW NOT ITSELF
AE_861 HAST THOU YET TO LEARN THAT THE LOVE OF THE HUMAN IS LOVE IS DIVINE IS BUT A LOWER FORM OF THE PART OF THE LOVE OF GOD
AE_862 HE THAT LOVETH NOT HIS BROTHER WHOM HE HATH SEEN AS A I LOVE GOD WHOM HE HATH NOT SEEN
AE_863 A SOB LIKE A BIRD NEW BORN BURST FROM MARYS BOSOM
AE_864 HE STARTED TO CONSCIOUS CONFUSION ONLY NEITHER KNOWING WHERE HE WAS NOR WHAT HE DID
AE_865 HIS VIOLIN WAS BROKEN BUT HIS BEING WAS MADE WHOLE
AE_866 LOOKS LIKE A CLUMP OF BUSHES DOWN THERE BUT I AINT SURE CAN YOU MAKE IT OUT
AE_867 DONT LIVE AROUND LIKE PREVECTLYSTILLWARNSTHE GUIDE ARE YOU HURT
AE_868 AND THAT TUMLESONNOUGHTONOTTHESENSEOUTOF A FULL GROWN MAN
AE_869 I COULD NOT THINK OF ALLOWING ANY OF MY CHARGES TO TAKE SO TERRIBLE A RISK AND
AE_86 IF THE ORIGINAL IS TO IN THE WORLD I THINK HE MIGHT DEFY THE SUN TO MAKE HIM LOOK STERN AND HARD
AE_870 YOU HAVE OTHER WAS OF THE BOOM HE ELECTED TO YOU TO TAKE CARE OF THIS END
AE_871 ARE YOU READY YES
AE_872 LIGE QUICKLY MADE FAST THE LINE TO A TREE
AE_873 I SEE HIM CALLED TAD HIS VOICE SENDING HOLLOW AND A NATURAL TO THOSE ABOVE
AE_874 HE IS SO FAR TO THE RIGHT OF ME THAT I CANT REACH HIM
AE_876 BUT FROM THE CAUTIOUS BEETS OF THE LIGHT FAR BELOW THEM THE GUIDE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE LAD WAS AT WORK CARRYING OUT HIS PART OF THE TASK OF RESCUE TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY
AE_877 MAYBE YOU THINK HE SAVED SOME SORT OF A PICNIC DOWN THERE A PLAIN OBLIGE
AE_878 HE NO DOUBT WOULD BRING FOOD OF SOME KIND WITH HIM
AE_879 CALLED WATER IS THE MOST NOURISHING THAN TOUCHED SINCE LAST NIGHT
AE_87 IS THERE NOTHING WILD IN THE EYE CONTINUED HOLGRAVE SO EARNESTLY THAT IT EMBARRASSED PHEBEASDIDALSOTHEQUIETFREEDOMWITH WHICH HE PRESUMED ON THEIR SO RECENT ACQUAINTANCE

AE_882 AND EXPLAINED CHUNKY STRETCHING HIS NECK AND EYEING THE DISH LONGINGLY
AE_883 NOW FALL TO YOUNG MAN DIRECTED THE PROFESSOR
AE_884 HE BURIED HIS BISCUIT UNDER A LAYER OF JAM OVER WHICH HE SPREAD A THICK COATING OF HONEY
AE_885 I RECKON THERE ARE SMILED THE GUIDE WE ARE IN THE BEAR COUNTRY NOW
AE_886 YES THE COUNTRY IS FULL OF CAVES
AE_887 SUPER HAVING BEEN FINISHED THE PARTY GATHERED ABOUT THE CAMP FIRE FOR THEIR EVENING CHAT AFTER WHICH ADMONISHING STACY TO KEEP WITHIN HIS TENT AND NOT TO GO BORROWING TROUBLE THE BOYS TURNED IN FOR A SOUND SLEEP
AE_888 THE BOYS WERE NOW ALL ANXIETY TO START WHILE THE PONIES AFTER THEIR SUNDAY REST WERE ALMOST AS FULL OF LIFE AS WERE THEIR OWNERS
AE_889 AND ONLY SHOT WITH STATE SO THAT THE PARTY REACHED THE PROMISED TABLE LANDS SHORTLY BEFORE TEN OCLOCK IN THE FORENOON
AE_88 IT IS NONSENSE SAID PHOEBE A LITTLE IMPATIENTLY FOR US TO TALK ABOUT A PICTURE WHICH YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN
AE_890 HE TIOPORARYCAWASQUICKLYPITCHED

AE_897 WHATS MORE STACY APPROACHED THE SOMBRERO HIS PONY RUNNING WELL AND AS HE DREW NEAR IT THEY SAW HIM RISE IN THE SADDLE JUST AS TAD BUTLER HAD DONE A FEW MINUTES BEFORE
AE_898 AS A RESULT INSTEAD OF STOPPING WHEN HE REACHED THE HAT THE BOY KEPT ON GOING
AE_899 CHAPTER FOUR THE FIRST NIGHT IN CAMP
AE_89 SINCE YOU ARE A FRIEND OF MY COUSIN HEPSAPLS YOU SHOULD ASK HER TO SHOW YOU THE PICTURE
AE_8 HE SEEMED TO BE CURSING PEOPLE WOULD ROUND HIM
AE_900 NOT ON THE RANGE WHY NOT DEMANDED THE BOY
AE_901 THE PONY DID MOST OF IT ADMITTED THE LAD I JUST GAVE HIM HIS HEAD AND THATS ALL THERE WAS TO IT
AE_902 WEVE GOT A HARD DRIVE BEFORE IN EVERY BAD MUST BE FIT AS A FIDDLE
AE_903 HE GUARDEDCURLEYASIMS
AE_904 THE COWBOY DID THIS VERY THING THOUGH WITHIN AN HOUR HE FOUND HIMSELF ALONE THE OTHERS HAD BEEN TURNED IN ONE BY ONE
AE_905 THE LADS FOUND THAT A PAIR OF BLANKETS HAD ASSIGNED TO EACH OF THEM WITH AN ORDINARY WAGON SHEET DOUBLED FOR A CARLIN
AE_906 THESE THEY SPREAD OUT ON THE GROUND USING BOOTS WRAPPED IN COATS FOR PILLOWS

AE_918 WHY NOT ALLOW YOUR SILVER TUFTS TO LUXURIATE IN A NATURAL MANNER
AE_91 BUT PUT IT ON THE TABLE IN THE CORNER OF THE PASSAGE
AE_920 HE REALLY GRIEVED TO SEE IT
AE_922 INDEED NOT A FLOWER ESCAPED HIS MISCHIEVOUS SUGGESTIONS
AE_923 ECHOED THE FLOWERS TREMULOUSLY AS WITH A SORT OF FEARFUL PLEASURE THEY AWAITED HIS APPROACH
AE_924 MAKING A SORT OF EDDYING CIRCUIT ROUND THE GARDEN HE KNOCKED OVER THE CONVAOLVILISPOLE TORE THE STRIPS FROM THE STICK THAT HELD UP THE WHITE LILY LOOSED ALL THE CARNATION FLOWERS FROM THEIR FASTENINGS BROKE THE ROSE TREE DOWN AND LEVELLED THE SWEET PEAS TO THE GROUND
AE_925 MEANWHILE HOW FARED IT WITH THE FLOWERS
AE_926 OH THAT SHE WERE ONCE MORE CLIMBING UP THE FRIENDLY FIR POLE
AE_927 BEFORE THE DAY CLOSED THE GARDENER CAME WHISTLING FROM HIS FARM WORK TO LOOK OVER HIS PRETTY CHARGES
AE_928 BUT FOR THE SIGHT THAT AWAITED HIM HE WAS NOT PREPARED AT ALL
AE_929 IN THIS POSITION SHE REMAINED UNTIL A GENTLE HAND WAS LAID UPON HER SHOULDER
AE_92 HOW WONDERFULLY RESPONSIVE TO EVERY EMOTION OF THE HUMAN SOUL
AE_930 I AM NOT THINKING ABOUT THE GARDEN MAMMA REPLIED THE YOUNG GIRL WITHOUT LIFTING UP HER FACE WE CAN PLANT NEW FLOWERS AND TIE UP EVEN SOME OF THESE AFRESH
AE_931 IN THOSE VERY EARLY TIMES THERE WAS A MAN NAMED DUCALEANANDHEWASTHESONOFPROMETHEUS
AE_932 THESE MEN HE SAID TO HIS MIGHTY COMPANY ARE NOTHING BUT A SOURCE OF TROUBLE
AE_933 NO ONE BUT DOCALIENTHESONYOFPROMETHEUSWASREADYFORSUCHASTORM
AE_934 THE DAY IS COMING SAID PROMETHEUS WHEN JUPITER WILL SEND A FLOOD TO DESTROY MANKIND FROM THE EARTH
AE_935 BUT DEKALIONANDPERAWEREVERYSADFORTHEYKNEWTHATTHEYWERETHEONLYPERSONSWHOWERELEFTALIVEINALLTHELAND
AE_936 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH HE ASKED
AE_937 WE SHOULD LIKE ABOVE ALL THINGS SAID DUCANIANTO SEE THIS LAND FULL OF PEOPLE ONCE MORE FOR WITHOUT NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS THE WORLD IS A VERY LONELY PLACE INDEED
AE_938 WHAT DID HE MEAN ASKED PARA
AE_939 WHEN AT LAST THE QUEEN GAVE BIRTH TO A DAUGHTER THE KING WAS SO OVERJOYED THAT HE GAVE A GREAT CHRISTENING FEAST THE LIKE OF WHICH HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN
AE_93 FEWER WORDS THAN BEFORE BUT WITH THE SAME MYSTERIOUS MUSIC IN THEM
AE_940 ONE OF THE YOUNG FAIRIES OVERHEARING HER AND FANCYING SHE MIGHT WORK SOME MISCHIEF TO THE LITTLE BABY WENT AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE HANGINGS IN THE HALL SO AS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE LAST WORD AND UNDO ANY HARM THE OLD FAIRY MIGHT WISH TO WORK
AE_941 THE TURN OF THE OLD FAIRY HAD NOW COME AND SHE DECLARED WHILE HER HEAD SHOOK WITH MALICE THAT THE PRINCESS SHOULD PIERCE HER HAND WITH A SPINDLE AND DIE OF THE WORLD
AE_942 IT IS TRUE I CANNOT ENTIRELY UNDO WHAT MY ELDER HAS DONE
AE_943 SHE HAD NO SOONER TAKEN UP THE SPINDLE THAN BEING HASTY AND CARELESS SHE PIERCED HER HAND WITH THE POINT OF IT AND FAINTED AWAY
AE_944 HE KNEW THAT SHE WOULD NOT AWAKE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS
AE_945 ONE SAID IT WAS AN ENCHANTED CASTLE ANOTHER THAT WHICH IS IS THERE BUT MOST BELIEVED THAT IT WAS OCCUPIED BY A GREAT OGRE WHICH CARRIED THITHER ALL THE CHILDREN HE COULD CATCH AND ATE THEM UP ONE AT A TIME FOR NOBODY COULD GET AT HIM THROUGH THE WOOD
AE_946 SCARCELY HAD HE COME TO THE WOOD WHEN ALL THE TREES AND THORNS WHICH HAD MADE SUCH AN IMPENETRABLE THICKET OPENED ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER TO OFFER IN THE PATH
AE_94 PRAY GO TO BED FOR I AM SURE YOU MUST NEED REST
AE_95 AT SOME UNCERTAIN PERIOD IN THE DEPTHS OF NIGHT AND AS IT WERE THROUGH THE THIN VEIL OF A DREAM SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A FOOTSTEP MOUNTING THE STAIRS HEAVILY BUT NOT WITH FORCE AND DECISION
AE_98 TO HIM THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF HIS WIFES SISTER WAS A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE
AE_99 HIS AMBITION WAS SOME DAY TO BUILD A HOUSE ON THEM
AE_9 QUICKLY IT WAS COVERED WITH BRIGHT RED SPOTS I THOUGHT I HAD NEVER SEEN ANY BLOOD SO BRIGHT
