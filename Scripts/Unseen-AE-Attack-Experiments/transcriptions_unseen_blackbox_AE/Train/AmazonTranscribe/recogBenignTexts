2412-153954-0005 Each feature was finished. Eyelids, eyelashes and ears being almost invariably perfect.
2412-153954-0008 The men were as handsome as the women beautiful.
2412-153954-0016 In fact, one of them was plainly very much out of health and coughed violently from time to time in spite of manifest efforts to suppress it.
2428-83699-0004 The whole thing was a trifle odd.

2428-83705-0036 Someone snickered.
251-118436-0003 As you well know. There are ten men and ten women whose sole duty is to taste his food and wine, and fifty armed warriors guard his chamber as they guarded now.
251-118436-0005 The man shrugged his broad shoulders and turned back into the arabesque chamber.

251-136532-0017 Tony latimer, the discoverer was beginning to cash in on his attentions to gloria and his ingratiation with sid. He was always either making voice and image talks for telecast or listening to the news from the home planet.
251-136532-0019 Not that i'm interested in all this for myself, he disclaimed after listening to the telecast from terra two days after his discovery.
251-137823-0006 Bud threw up his arms to protect himself, but too late.
251-137823-0014 They picked their way through the wreckage and emerged on a scene of frightful destruction.
251-137823-0017 Anyhow, we want to help. Got a job for us.
2803-154320-0006 What then my lord.
2803-154320-0007 God keep us from such a meeting. Why, john ?

2803-154328-0004 If it is decreed that we die tomorrow, let us die bravely. Like christian man ready to appear without terror before the supreme judge.
2803-154328-0015 Wilson and open net joined their companions and all united to dig through the wall. John with his dagger, the others with stones taken from the ground or with their nails. While i'm already stretched along the ground, watch the native guard to her crevice of the matting.

2902-9006-0005 Julien's last attempt to restore paganism by imperial influence had only proved that the old faith had lost all hold upon the hearts of the masses. At his death, the great tide wave of new opinion rolled on unchecked, and the rulers of earth were fain to swim with the stream to accept and words. At least the church's laws is theirs. To acknowledge a king of kings to whom even they owed homage and obedience and to call their own slaves. They're poorer brethren and often to their spirituals superiors.
2902-9006-0014 How iniquitous was the conduct of the sons of theodosius.

3081-166546-0026 He was late, of course. But when he did appear, i almost forgot our usual greeting in my hurry to ask him if he had seen the evening papers.
3081-166546-0030 They're greeting was cordial, and the lines on the ladders face relaxed a little as he met the still bright eye of the man upon whose instinct and judgment so much reliance had always been placed.
3081-166546-0035 At least that is what we hope.

6345-93302-0003 She had to the full limit allowed of her reading in her environment the literary sense.
6345-93302-0008 He had been late, he had offered no excuse, no explanation.
6345-93302-0023 I didn't think a decent man could do such things. She was pulling on her gloves, go home and gloat over it all.
6345-93302-0026 And he strode down between the marble tables and out by the swing door. It was a very good exit.
6345-93302-0027 At the corner. He remembered that he had gone away without paying for the tea, and his natural impulse was to go back and remedy that error.
6345-93302-0028 He checked the silly impulse.
6345-93306-0010 He had no time to think, but he was aware that this was the most exciting adventure that had ever happened to him.

652-130726-0020 At the corner of market and eddy streets is the odeon down in the basement with decorations of most garish order.
652-130726-0022 But if you really love good music music that has melody and rhythm and soothing cadences, go to the heidelberg in and listen to the concert, which is a feature of the place every evening.
777-126732-0008 His enunciation would have been almost totally unintelligible to a stranger.
777-126732-0024 The shadow of his evil gift clung to him yet like the smell of a deadly drug in an old vial of poison empty now useless, ready to be thrown away upon the rubbish heap of things that had served their time.
777-126732-0033 Comrade oxygen's face twitched with exasperation.
777-126732-0066 There was no young man of his age in london more willing and docile than stephen, she affirmed, none more affectionate and ready to please and even useful as long as people did not upset his poor head.
7850-111771-0005 He was now commander of all the federal forces.
7850-281318-0004 And the poor silly things ruffled up their feathers and looked miserable as only a little bird can look when it is unhappy.
7850-281318-0007 And she saw all the other birds hopping about and twittering helplessly.
7850-281318-0010 Oh wise mother make pie, dear mother make pie they cried teach us how to build our nests like yours for. It is growing night and we are tired and sleepy
7850-281318-0014 And some of the birds who were attentive and careful soon saw how it was done and started nice homes for themselves.
7850-281318-0019 You say ? You know all about it. Then go on and finish your nests by yourselves.
1272-135031-0009 He doesn't work at all.
1272-141231-0004 One minute, a voice said, and the time buzzer sounded.
1272-141231-0006 The buzzers were triggered his muscles into complete relaxation.
1462-170138-0002 I happened to have mcconnell's box for tonight, or there'd be no chance of our getting places.
1462-170138-0010 When she began to dance by way of showing the go soon's what she had seen in the fairy rings at night, the house broke into a prolonged up for.
1462-170142-0005 She calls his name on the threshold. But in her swift flight across the room, she felt a change in him and caught herself up so definitely that he could not tell just when she did it.
1462-170142-0013 It hasn't always made you miserable, has it ?
1462-170142-0021 Could you could you sit down and talk about it quietly ? Partly as if i were a friend and not someone who had to be defied.
1462-170142-0039 You see, loving someone as i love you makes the whole world different.
1673-143396-0001 Their churches have disappeared, their books are obliterated, their obscure freedom might allow latitude of faith, and the softness of their infant creed would be variously molded by the zeal or prudence of three hundred years.
1673-143396-0018 He acquiesced in the old distinction of the greek philosopher is between the rational and sensitive soul of man, that he might reserve the logos for intellectual functions and employed the subordinate human principle in the meaner actions of animal life.
1673-143397-0000 Ardant. In the prosecution of heresy, carol auspiciously opened his reign by oppressing innovations the most innocent and harmless of the sect aries.
1673-143397-0002 Such crimes would have deserved the animate version of the magistrate. But in this promiscuous outrage, the innocent were confounded with the guilty and alexandria was impoverished by the loss of a wealthy and industrious colony.
174-168635-0002 His sister and his sister's children had left him only a vague and far off memory, which had finally, almost completely vanished. He had made every effort to find them and not having been able to find them he had for gotten them.
174-168635-0003 He suffered all the pangs of a mother, and he knew not what it meant for that great and singular movement of a heart which begins to love is a very obscure and a very sweet thing.
174-168635-0004 Only as he was five and fifty and close at eight years of age, all that might have been loved in the whole course of his life flowed together into a sort of ineffable light.
174-168635-0011 Moreover, gene va in had chosen his refuge well.
174-168635-0015 And then he talked too, for mother and he made her prey.

174-84280-0002 It is theo expression of life under cruder and more rigid conditions that ours lived by people who loved and hated more naively aged sooner and died younger than we do.
174-84280-0004 And already this astounding blow begins to take its place, among other events as a thing strange and terrible indeed, but related to all the strangeness and mystery of life, part of the universal mysteries of despair and futility and death that have troubled by consciousness since childhood.
174-84280-0015 She was destroyed not merely by the unconsidered undisc planned passions of her husband and her lover, but by the vast tradition that sustains and enforces the subject ation of her sex.

1988-147956-0019 We stood panting on the edge of the ravine, looking down at the trees and bushes that grew below us.
1988-147956-0020 The wind was so strong that i had to hold my hat on and the girls skirts were blown out before them.
1988-147956-0027 After antonia had said the new words over and over, she wanted to give me a little chased silver ring that she wore on her middle finger.
1988-147956-0029 I became somewhat embarrassed for i was used to being taken for granted by my elders.
1988-148538-0002 I believe the seriousness of the americans arises partly from their pride.
1988-148538-0007 Chapter sixteen. Why the national vanity of the americans is more restless and captures than that of the english.
1988-148538-0008 The americans, in their intercourse with strangers, appear impatient, the smallest center and insatiable of praise.
1988-148538-0014 When an aristocracy carries on the public affairs, it's national pride naturally assumes this reserved, indifferent and haughty form, which is imitated by all the other classes of the nation.
1988-24833-0004 Right away. When i bring home my new program, he says, how come you're taking one less course this half ?
1988-24833-0008 I'll be lucky if i have time to breathe.
1988-24833-0010 So he cares, huh ?
1988-24833-0015 You're getting altogether too upset about these programs. Stop it and behave yourself.
1988-24833-0024 Tom drinks a little more coffee, and then he goes on. The trouble is, i can't get married on this flower shop job.
1993-147149-0010 Wishing him, said mary in a tone of inquiry.
1993-147149-0011 Then the mother lifted up her voice and wept.
1993-147149-0017 Oh, jim, don't give way, so i cannot bear to see you.
1993-147149-0018 He did not speak as though fearing to destroy by sound or motion the happiness that moment, when her soft hands touched, thrilled through his frame and her silvery voice was whispering tenderness in his ear.
1993-147149-0025 I think i can not go right. Poor either checked myself till i'm downright cross to him or else i speak just natural. And that's too kind and tender by half.
1993-147964-0009 From under the lining. He now produced a collection of brilliantly colored paper figures, several inches high and stiff enough to stand alone.
1993-147965-0000 Grandfather came down wearing a white shirt and his sunday coat.
1993-147965-0002 He gave thanks for our food and comfort and prayed for the poor and destitute and great cities where the struggle for life was harder than it was here with us.
1993-147966-0002 Your mama, i said angrily, wants other people's things.
2035-147960-0004 It was on one of these gravel beds that i met my adventure.
2035-147960-0008 A faint, fetid smell came from him, and a thread of green liquid oozed from his crushed head.
2035-147961-0012 He lay patiently, fighting for breath like a child with croup.
2035-147961-0021 Something happened to the hind most sledge. The driver lost control. He was probably very drunk. The horse has left the road. The sledge was caught up in a clump of trees and overturned.
2035-147961-0032 The first thing either of them noticed was a new sound that broke into the clean air louder than they had ever heard it before. The bell of the monastery of their own village, ringing for early prayers.
2035-147961-0034 Wherever they went, the story followed them.

2086-149220-0005 He's too strange to say, had thought it worth their while to come hither, possibly from the range of hives besides some farmhouse miles away.
2086-149220-0008 It was evident that the race had degenerated, like many a noble race besides, in consequence of too strict a watchfulness to keep it pure.
2086-149220-0022 If you would permit me, said the artist. Looking at phoebe. I should like to try whether the dig arrow type can bring out disagreeable traits on a perfectly amiable face.
2086-149220-0029 I can assure you that this is a modern face and one which you will very probably meet.
2086-149220-0034 If the original is still in the world, i think he might defy the son to make him look stern and hard.
2086-149220-0036 It is nonsense, said phoebe, a little impatiently for us to talk about a picture which you have never seen.
2086-149220-0043 What an instrument is the human voice.
2086-149220-0046 Pray go to bed for i am sure you must need rest.

2277-149896-0004 How would the papers talk about it ?
2277-149896-0005 Many little wrinkles gathered between his eyes as he contemplated this and his brown, moist and
2277-149896-0007 He would see how things turned out tomorrow, and then he would talk to her. They were going to meet a cz usual.
2277-149897-0005 It was with great opposition after two or three hours of the most urgent mental affirmation in denial that at last he got an envelope placed in it the requested amount and slowly sealed it up.
2277-149897-0017 How about that now ? His pain at her failure to meet or write him rapidly increased as he devoted himself to the subject.
2277-149897-0021 He saw a busy saturday ushered out the sabbath in and nothing done.
2277-149897-0028 He would explain to her just where he stood and how much he needed her.
2277-149897-0029 He did manage to bring himself into the mood to go out to carry, but when he got in ogden place, he thought he saw a man watching him and went away.
2412-153947-0005 I am surprised, however, that the book at which such an example of the species misuse of analogy would seem most naturally leveled should have occurred to know reviewer neither shall i mention the name of the book here, though i should fancy that the hint given will suffice.
2412-153948-0011 So lonely and so solemn with the sad great clouds above and no sound save a lost lamb bleeding upon the mountainside as though it's a little hard we're breaking.
2412-153948-0012 Each must cry louder and wander, father. Yet may luck be with them both that they may find their own at nightfall.
2412-153948-0015 I would try the nearer range and see how far i could go.
2412-153954-0006 Their expression was divine, and as they glanced at me timidly but with parted lips and great bewilderment, i forgot all thoughts of their conversion and feelings that were far more earthly.
2412-153954-0012 The country was highly cultivated, every ledge being planted with chestnuts, walnuts and apple trees from which the apples were now gathering.
2412-153954-0019 But by and by they came to my watch, which i had hidden away in the inmost pocket that i had and had forgotten when they began their search.
2412-153954-0021 We passed many cases and at last came to one in which there were several clocks in two or three old watches.
2428-83699-0002 The reply was written in a sprawling, feminine hand. It was a little vague.
2428-83699-0024 I was chilled to the bone. Wet, tired, hungry.
2428-83699-0025 I had long been wishing that an old fashioned christmas had been completely extinct before i had thought of adventuring in quest of one.
2428-83699-0028 There's a knocker if none of them haven't twisted it off.
2428-83699-0040 After a vast amount of unfasten ing, the door was opened, and on the threshold there stood a girl with a lighted candle in her hand.
2428-83705-0003 It is most delightful.
2428-83705-0005 For instance, look at their behavior in the matter of the ring.
2428-83705-0009 That's it on your account.
2428-83705-0029 I noticed that they are generally persons who have already tendered their offerings.

251-118436-0008 With a long stained fingernail, he mapped the constellations on the marble tiled floor.
251-136532-0009 Well, of course they're dead. What a question.

251-136532-0023 The organization of a society of martian archaeology with anthony latimer, phd, the logical candidate for the chair.
251-137823-0021 Mr swift came into the living room just then and told tom how worried mrs swift and sandy had been.
251-137823-0023 He's a great scientist.
2803-154320-0001 John mangles therefore hoped that the wretched hole would reach port without accident, but it grieved him that his companions should have to suffer so much discomfort from the defective arrangements of the brig.
2803-154320-0002 They're friends did their best to amuse him.
2803-154328-0008 I believe said john, that in the sight of god, i have a right to fulfill that promise.
2803-161169-0006 Look a little closer while our guide lets the light of his lamp fall upon the blackwall at your side.
2803-161169-0013 Then the hills were piled up on top of it all. But here and there, some edge of a coal bed was tilted up and appeared above the ground.
2902-9006-0000 One who rights of such an era labors under a troublesome disadvantage.
2902-9006-0001 In the present case that disadvantages doubled for while the sins of the church, however heinous, were still such as admit of being expressed in words, the sins of the heathen world against which she fought were utterly indescribable. And the christian apologised is thus compelled for the sake of decency to state the church's case, farm or weekly than the fax deserve.
2902-9006-0013 The huns singly, their inferiors pressed them from behind with the irresistible weight of numbers. Italy, with the rich cities and fertile lowlands, beckoned them on to plunder as auxiliaries. They had learned their own strength and a roman weakness. Acosta's belly was soon found.
2902-9008-0013 Not that such a creature is that disturbs me. No created thing, i hope can move my equanimity. But if i could stoop to hate, i should hate her, hate her.
3000-15664-0010 Every crystal dances responsive to the touches of the sun and the currents of sap in the growing cells of all, the vegetation are ever in a vital world and rush. And though many feet and wings air folded, how many are a stir ?
3000-15664-0021 Regaining the low ground at the base of the mountain and holding on in your grand orbit, you passed through a belt of juniper woods called the cedars two sheep brock at the foot of the shasta pass.
3000-15664-0024 Large flocks dwell here from year to year, winter and summer, descending occasionally into the adjacent sage plans and lava beds to feed but ever ready to take refuge and the jagged crags of their mountain and every alarm.
3000-15664-0029 Then fell the gloaming, making everything still more forbidding in mysterious.
3000-15664-0045 The great wilds of our country, once held to be boundless and inexhaustible, are being rapidly invaded and overrun in every direction, and everything destructive ble in them is being destroyed.
3081-166546-0008 George.
3081-166546-0019 I asked as soon as george had returned to my side.
3081-166546-0047 Very well, then. You're in a position to fire near me.
3081-166546-0063 No doubt.
3081-166546-0080 I know, she said, what you are going to ask me now ?
3170-137482-0012 We took our three prisoners to a large boat.
3170-137482-0020 I told him and he insisted upon my coming with him in the gondola, saying that he would leave me at my house.
3170-137482-0041 They were not only good christians and faithful to the church, but even really devote ease and full of scruples.

3536-23268-0027 What he said. He looked with so much sincerity that had she been burning with rage at his late behavior, she must have forgiven him for the regret which he so forcibly expressed.
3536-23268-0030 Keep your appointment and be assured that i shall issue my commands with more circumspection for the future as i find how strictly they are complied with.
3536-8226-0022 Mrs basel, who well understood that business was business and that wives were not business, felt no anger at this and handed her husband his best coat.
3576-138058-0012 Don quixote did so and asked him what had happened to him and what he was afraid off.
3576-138058-0015 He was mounted upon a powerful horse and had on a coat of mail with four of the pistols they called patron l's in that country at his waist.
3576-138058-0019 Give me my horse and arms and wait for me here. I will go in quest of this night and dead or alive. I will make him keep his word. Plight it too. So great beauty.
3576-138058-0030 Sancho said they had, but that three kerchiefs that were were three cities were missing.
3576-138058-0035 And if you have any desire to shorten the journey and put yourself easily in the way of salvation, come with me and i will show you how to become a knight. Errant ah calling where in so many hardships and mishaps are encountered that if they be taken his penance is they will lodge you in heaven in a try, sce.
3576-138058-0037 The captain showed plainly the concern. They felt the region's lady was downcast and the pilgrims did not at all enjoy seeing their property confiscated.
3752-4943-0024 Just as he reached it, however, the figure of mr north rose from behind a pile of stones.
3752-4944-0000 Captain frayer says that the scenery is delightful.
3752-4944-0001 Abandoned. Indeed, by god and man almost.
3752-4944-0007 I was quartered with him at sarah island.
3752-4944-0023 Dead, said dr mcelwain.
3752-4944-0032 Mr meek and expressed some alarm, but dr mcelwain reassured him.
3752-4944-0057 They shall not flog that boy, he said.
3752-4944-0064 It was a cz, though he had reached the crisis of a disease which had been for days gathering force.
3853-163249-0002 So christy turned a deaf ear to her prophetic soul and gave herself up to the blissful holiday that had come at last.
3853-163249-0005 I'm not a talker, you know. And as the laws of gravitation forbid my soaring aloft anywhere, i can only express my joyfully uplifted state of mind by prancing as you call it.
3853-163249-0006 I don't want you to. I love to see you so young and happy on lee. You are not the old david, and i've got to get acquainted with the new one.
3853-163249-0011 I shall wait for time to show.
3853-163249-0020 He's a kind, neighborly man, and his boy will take my place about the house and to protect you faithfully.
3853-163249-0040 Now let's be brave and enjoy every minute of it.
