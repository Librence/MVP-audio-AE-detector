 1272-141231-0024 this is physically impossible when conscious
 1462-170138-0009 its delightful to hear it in a london theatre
 1462-170138-0021 he bowed as the warning bell rang and made how whispered you know lord westmere of course the stooped man with the long gray mustache talking to lady dowle
 1462-170138-0024 he leaned forward and beamed felicitations as warmly as mainhall himself when at the end of the play she came again and again before the curtain panting a little and flushed her eyes dancing and her eager nervous little mouth tremulous with excitement
 1462-170138-0025 all the same he lifted his glass heres to you little hilda
 1462-170142-0000 the last two days of the voyage bartley found almost intolerable
 1462-170142-0006 she merely brushed his cheek with her lips and put a hand lightly and joyously on either shoulder
 1462-170142-0011 he pulled up a window as if the air were heavy
 1462-170142-0012 hilda watched him from her corner trembling and scarcely breathing dark shadows growing about her eyes
 1462-170142-0016 i am not a man who can live two lives he went on feverishly each life spoils the other
 1462-170142-0030 i understand bartley i was wrong
 1462-170142-0032 you want me to say it she whispered
 1462-170142-0042 dont cry dont cry he whispered
 1462-170145-0001 over the fireplace there was a large old fashioned gilt mirror
 1462-170145-0003 of course i know bartley she said at last that after this you wont owe me the least consideration but we sail on tuesday
 1462-170145-0007 i told myself that if i were really thinking of you and not of myself a letter would be better than nothing
 1462-170145-0009 oh bartley did you write to me
 1462-170145-0012 he bent his face over her hair
 1462-170145-0021 alexander flushed angrily
 1673-143396-0003 his progress from infancy to youth and manhood was marked by a regular increase in stature and wisdom and after a painful agony of mind and body he expired on the cross
 1673-143396-0009 he first appeared on the banks of the jordan in the form of perfect manhood but it was a form only and not a substance a human figure created by the hand of onividence to imitate the faculties and actions of a man and to impose a perpetual illusion on the senses of his friends and enemies
 1673-143396-0014 but the justice and generosity of such a desertion are strongly questionable and the fate of an innocent martyr at first impelled and at length abandoned by his divine companion might provoke the pity and indignation of the profane
 1673-143397-0006 which oppressed the metropolitans of europe and asia invaded the provinces of antioch in alexandria and measured their dies by the limits of the empire
 1673-143397-0010 the vanity of celestine was flattered by the appeal and the partial version of a monk decided the faith of the pope who with his latin clergy was ignorant of the language the arts and the theology of the greeks
 1673-143397-0017 but in this awful moment of the danger of the church their vow was superseded by a more sublime and indispensable duty
 174-168635-0007 the man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor she thought jean velshonhandsome just as she thought the huffle pretty
 174-168635-0017 the best of us are not i sat from egotistical thoughts
 174-50561-0002 but this is a fallacy

 174-50561-0018 bed time children
 174-84280-0001 it seems to me more and more as i live longer that most poetry and most literature and particularly the literature of the past is discordant with the vastness and variety the reserves and resources and recuperations of life as we live it to day
 174-84280-0005 for a time the death of mary obscured her life for me but now her living presence is more in my mind again
 174-84280-0008 you were wrong in all that i said she kept her faith with you

 1988-147956-0004 presently against one of those banks i saw a sort of shed thatched with the same wine colored grass that grew everywhere
 1988-147956-0012 even from a distance one could see that there was something strange about this boy
 1988-147956-0018 i noticed how white and well shaped his own hands were
 1988-147956-0022 she pointed into the gold cottonwood tree behind his top we stood and said again what name
 1988-147956-0025 she was quick and very eager
 1988-148538-0006 in aristocracies every man has one sole object which he unceasingly pursues but amongst democratic nations the existence of man is more complex the same mind will almost always embrace several objects at the same time and these objects are frequently wholly foreign to each other as it cannot know them all well the mind is readily satisfied with imperfect notions of each
 1988-148538-0009 if i say to an american that the country he lives in is a fine one ay he replies there is not its fellow in the world
 1988-148538-0012 they therefore entertain a calm sense of their superiority they do not dream of vaunting privileges which everyone perceives and no one contests and these things are not sufficiently new to them to be made topics of conversation
 1988-24833-0002 she doesnt pick them up but just having them in the room sure doesnt give her asthma
 1988-24833-0009 sometimes schools do let kids take a lot of soft courses and then theyre out on a limb later huh

 1993-147149-0008 is there any chance for the other one think you
 1993-147149-0012 her cries brought her husband down to try with his aching heart to comfort hers
 1993-147149-0014 then alice broke the silence by saying
 1993-147964-0007 he used to help my father cut christmas trees for me in virginia and he had not forgotten how much i liked them
 1993-147965-0004 all afternoon he sat in the dining room
 2035-147961-0000 peter told his troubles to mister shimerda he was unable to meet a note which fell due on the first of november had to pay an exorbitant bonus on renewing it and to give a mortgage on his pigs and horses and even his no cow
 2035-147961-0003 we lay still and did not talk
 2035-147961-0010 he seemed to be cursing people would round him
 2035-147961-0014 from our bench we could see what a hollow case his body was
 2035-147961-0017 mister shimerda went with him
 2035-147961-0020 a black drove came up over the hill behind the wedding party
 2035-147961-0028 twenty thirty enough
 2035-147961-0029 now his mill horse was being almost dragged by the other two

 2086-149214-0002 the author has considered it hardly worth his while their port relentlessly to impale the story with its moral as with an iron rod or rather as by sticking a pin through a butterfly thus at once depriving it of life and causing it to stiffen in an ungainly and unnatural attitude
 2086-149214-0003 if permitted by the historical connection which though slight was essential to his plan the author would very willingly have avoided anything of this nature
 2086-149220-0001 the white double rosebush had evidently been propped up anew against the house since the commencement of the season and the territory and three damson trees which except a row of currant bushes constituted the only varieties of fruit bore marks of the recent amputation of several stuperflues or defective lends
 2086-149220-0002 there were also a few species of antique and hereditary flowers in no very flourishing condition but scrupulously weeded as if some person either out of love or curiosity had been anxious to bring them to such perfection as they were capable of attaining
 2086-149220-0010 they kept themselves alive unquestionably and laid now and then an egg and hatched a chicken not for any pleasure of their own but that the world might not absolutely lose what had once been so admirable a breed of fowls
 2086-149220-0015 they have known me much longer but never honor me with any familiarity though hardly a day passes without my bringing them food
 2086-149220-0017 ah but these hens answered the young man these hens of aristocratic lineage would scorn to understand the vulgar language of a barn yard fowl
 2086-149220-0020 i turn up the earth by way of pastime
 2086-149220-0026 yet the original wears to common eyes a very different expression
 2086-149220-0035 is there nothing wild in the eye continued holgrave so earnestly that it embarrassed phoebe as did also the quiet freedom with which he presumed on their so recent acquaintance
 2086-149220-0041 she was indistinctly aware however that the gaunt figure of the old gentlewoman was sitting in one of the straight backed chairs a little withdrawn from the window the faint gleam of which showed the blanched paleness of her cheek turned sideways towards a corner
 2277-149874-0005 she had some slight gift of observation and that sense so rich in every woman intuition
 2277-149874-0009 one could see that he was very much wrapped up in his offspring
 2277-149874-0011 he seemed to be thinking of something else
 2277-149874-0015 she wanted to make some reference to their relations upon the train but was too timid
 2277-149896-0006 he could arrange that satisfactorily for carrie would be glad to wait if necessary
 2277-149896-0009 while the danger had not lessened it had not as yet materialised and with him no news was good news
 2277-149896-0012 she had not been able to get away this morning
 2277-149896-0014 after a time he gave up waiting and drearily headed for the madison car
 2277-149896-0015 he went in and examined his letters but there was nothing from carrie
 2277-149896-0018 his first impulse was to write but four words in reply go to the devil
 2277-149896-0030 he began to wish that he had compromised in some way or other that he had sent the money perhaps he could do it up here
 2277-149897-0001 he could hardly realise how it had all come about
 2277-149897-0004 he was getting some vague comfort out of a good sugar but it was no penacefor the ill which affected him
 2277-149897-0007 you take this to this address he said handing him the envelope and give it to missus hurstwood yes sir said the boy
 2277-149897-0009 the boy hastened away and the manager fell to his musings
 2277-149897-0013 for relief he arose and joined in the conversation with a few friends who were drinking
 2277-149897-0019 three oclock came four five six and no letter
 2277-149897-0023 it was the worst sunday he had spent in his life
 2277-149897-0030 he did not go within a block of the house

 2412-153947-0002 on my return i purposely avoided looking into it until i had sent back my last revises to the printer
 2412-153947-0007 i must not conclude without expressing my most sincere thanks to my critics and to the public for the leniency and consideration with which they have treated my adventures
 2412-153947-0008 it was written in the upper ragettitadistrict of the cannerbary province as it then was of new zealand and appeared at christchurch in the press newspaper june thirteenth eighteen sixty three
 2412-153947-0011 i attribute its unlooked for success mainly to two early favourable reviews the first in the palmalgasatte of apriltwelfh and the second in the spectator of april twentieth
 2412-153947-0015 i am still fairly well satisfied with those parts of era that were repeatedly rewritten but from those that had only a single writing i would gladly cut out some forty or fifty pages if i could
 2412-153948-0000 if the reader will excuse me i will say nothing of my antecedents nor of the circumstances which led me to leave my native country the narrative would be tedious to him and painful to myself
 2412-153948-0004 sheepencattlewere introduced and bred with extreme rapidity men took up their fifty thousand or one hundred thousand acres of country going inland one behind the other till in a few years there was not an acre between the sea and the front ranges which was not taken up and stations either for sheep or cattle were spotted about at intervals of some twenty or thirty miles over the whole country
 2412-153948-0007 they were a good many sheep which i knew as two or three black ewes and a black lamb or two and several others which had some distinguishing mark whereby i could tell them
 2412-153954-0000 shortly after passing one of these chapels we came suddenly upon a village which started up out of the mist and i was alarmed lest i should be made an object of curiosity or dislike
 2412-153954-0004 even on this ledge of human society there was a stunted growth of shoplets which had taken root and vegetated somehow though as in an air mercantile of the bleakest
 2412-153954-0009 i have always delighted in and reverenced beauty but i felt simply abashed in the presence of such a splendid type a compound of all that is best in egyptian greek and italian
 2428-83699-0003 it appeared that the terms would be five guineas but there was no mention of the length of time which that fee would cover
 2428-83699-0007 i have never known a madge and yet from my boyhood upward i have desired to meet one
 2428-83699-0020 when the trap did appear it looked to me uncommonly like an open spring cart
 2428-83699-0031 better ring again suggested the driver hard
 2428-83699-0032 maybe theyre up to some of their games and once rousing
 2428-83699-0035 a voice inquired whos there
 2428-83705-0002 i do not know when it is going to be but it will be either next week or the week after certainly at the earliest possible moment and i shouldnt be at all surprised to learn that all mary anns things have been already bought and perhaps some of them marked
 2428-83705-0008 i gasped positively gasped
 2428-83705-0011 i never saw people like the snellings for possessing relatives in all sorts of lines
 2428-83705-0015 when she heard of my engagement with mary ann she wrote and suggested that we should spend our honeymoon in her cottage or pigstye and that i should pay her rent for it
 2428-83705-0017 i found that as a woman of business she was beyond all my expectations
 2428-83705-0025 i have drawn up a list of all the people who ought to give us a present and i shall tell them what they ought to give it wont be my fault if i dont get it
 2428-83705-0028 she has a knack of getting people to do what she wishes and to give her what she wants which is a little short of miraculous
 2428-83705-0037 i cannot pretend to explain why except on the supposition that romance is dead at least in that circle of society in which the snellings move
 251-118436-0000 he was young no spear had touched him no poison lurked in his wine
 251-118436-0006 this man was clad in a brown camel hair robe and sandals and a green turban was on his head
 251-118436-0017 their fingers sear me like fire
 251-118436-0019 there they strove to break the silver cord of life and thrust my soul into the body of a foul night weird their sorcery summoned up from hell ah
 251-136532-0001 bill shalorlologist had been going deeper and deeper into the old sea bottom of syrtis

 251-136532-0020 bring it to the public attention dramatize it
 251-137823-0008 then tom who had been stunned by some falling debris raised himself to a sitting position
 251-137823-0015 lets see about getting help for mister favour
 251-137823-0022 he smiled guiltily as he added but i must admit i was more than a little concerned myself
 2803-154320-0005 his eyes wandered sesously over the blank horizon
 2803-154320-0013 so that and that score there is little or no danger
 2803-154328-0002 the meal ended
 2803-154328-0019 the john mangles inserting the blade of his poniard avoided the knife which now protruded above the soil but seized the hand that wielded it
 2803-154328-0023 my child my child murmured lady helena the savages did not kill you
 2803-161169-0004 the entrance is light because it opens so wide but we can see that the floor slopes downward and the way looks dark and narrow before us
 2803-161169-0008 here is something different rounded like a nut shell you can split off one side and behold there is the nut lies snugly as does any cast at in the spur
 2803-161169-0012 these forests were of trees different in some ways from those we now great ferns as tall as his house and moses as high as little trees and tom leaves of enormous size
 2902-9006-0003 that divine word who is the light who lighteth every man which cometh into the world had awakened in the heart of mankind a moral craving never before felt in any strength except by a few isolated philosophers or prophets
 2902-9006-0009 but the health of a church depends not merely on the creed which it professes not even on the wisdom and holiness of a few great ecclesiastics but on the faith and virtue of its individual members
 2902-9006-0011 and the new blood at the era of this story was at hand
 2902-9006-0012 tribe after tribe was crowding down to the alps and traveling upon each other on the frontiers of the empire
 2902-9006-0016 that extraordinary reform in morals which according to salvian and his contemporaries the vandal conquerors worked in north africa availed them nothing they lost more than they gave

 3000-15664-0001 arctic beauty and desolation with their blessings and dangers only be found here to test the endurance and skill of adventurous climbers but far better than climbing the mountain is going around its warm futile base enjoying its bounties like a bee circling around a bank of flowers
 3000-15664-0011 slight rainstorms are likely to be encountered in a trip round the mountain but one may easily find shelter beneath well thatched trees that shed the rain like a roof
 3000-15664-0014 in setting out from strawberry valley by bearing off to the northwestward a few miles you may see
 3000-15664-0016 it is lined with embrledalgi and mosses and shaded with alder willow and thorn bushes which give it a fine setting
 3000-15664-0022 ho ye strike the old emigrant road which leads over the low divide to the eastern slopes of the mountain
 3000-15664-0034 thus the shes river issues from a large lake like spring and shasta valley and about two thirds of the volume of the mc cloud gushes forth in a grand spring on the east side of the mountain a few miles back from its immediate base

 3000-15664-0043 the lofty icy shasta towering high above all seems but an hours walk from you though the distance in an air line is about sixty miles
 3081-166546-0001 instantly they absorbed all my attention though i dared not give them a direct look and continued to observe them only in the glass
 3081-166546-0003 the lady is not the mother of the boys but their aunt
 3081-166546-0005 george nodded
 3081-166546-0006 the boys look quite awake enough if the father does not
 3081-166546-0012 a man was looking in from the corridor behind at the four persons we were just discussing
 3081-166546-0032 its the most inexplicable there

 3081-166546-0071 as her quiet figure appeared in the doorway sweetwater stole a glance at mister gryce
 3081-166546-0081 there was no poured in the wound
 3081-166546-0082 the time is narrowed down to one and in that one miss clarke was the only person to touch her
 3081-166546-0087 no weapon protruded from the wound nor was any found on or near her in the mezsenine what follows
 3081-166546-0088 she struck the blow herself and the strength of purpose which led her to do this gave her the additional force to pull the weapon out and fling it from her

 3170-137482-0011 the waiter of the magazzino came to be paid and our chief gave him what was due enjoining silence under penalty of death
 3170-137482-0015 my readers may imagine whether we felt inclined to laugh when the charming creature bade us good night thanking us all with perfect good faith
 3170-137482-0022 i jumped out of the gondola and found myself on the very spot where three years before i had taught razetta such a forcible lesson i enquired for a surgeon at the first coffee house and ran to the house that was pointed out to me
 3170-137482-0024 thinking i had the right to watch the sick man i settled myself near his bed to give him every care he required
 3170-137482-0033 the three friends were astounded
 3170-137482-0034 i declared myself quite willing for it was necessary to brazen it out after having ventured as far as i had done
 3170-137482-0035 he wrote the question and gave it to me i read it i could not understand either the subject or the meaning of the words but it did not matter i had to give an answer
 3170-137482-0039 they believed that through me they possessed the philosophers stone the universal panacea the intercourse with all the elementary heavenly and infernal spirits and they had no doubt whatever that thanks to my sublime science they could find out the secrets of every government in europe
 3170-137482-0042 as for the eucharist transubstantiation the real presence it was all no mystery to them but palpable evidence and yet they were not jesuits
 3170-137482-0045 whoever you may be i am indebted to you for my life
 3170-137482-0048 i threw myself at his feet to assure him of my gratitude and embraced him calling him my father
 3536-23268-0001 every time he beheld the object of his passion for he still continued his visits though not so frequently as heretofore he pleaded his cause with such ardour that miss woodley who was sometimes present and ever compassionate could not resist wishing him success
 3536-23268-0003 night after night his sleep had been disturbed by fears for her when abroad morning after morning it had been broken by the clamour of her return
 3536-23268-0004 i hope miss milner you pass this evening at home
 3536-23268-0007 missus horton rose from her seat moved the decanters and fruit round the table stirred the fire and came back to her seat again before another word was uttered
 3536-23268-0010 and he walked immediately out of the apartment by another door
 3536-23268-0020 miss woodley did not recollect herself so but was so in reality in her peace and charity were instinctive virtues accident could not increase them
 3536-23268-0021 he coughed drank his tea endeavor to talk but found it difficult sometimes read and in this manner near two hours were passed away when miss milner came into the room not dressed for a ball but as she had risen from dinner
 3536-23268-0024 door forth then laid the book out of his hand and by the time the servant had left the room thus began
 3536-23268-0025 it is often the ungrateful task of a friend to be troublesome sometimes unmannerly
 3536-23268-0029 on this he rose from his chair and going to her said once more shew your submission by obeying me a second time to day
 3536-8226-0001 and now it had come to pass that his sole remaining ally mister samuel bozzle the ex policeman was becoming weary of his service
 3536-8226-0004 missus bozzle was disposed to think that ladies of quality among whom madame t was entitled in her estimation to take rank were seldom better than they ought to be and she was quite willing that her husband should earn his bread by watching the lady or the ladys lover
 3536-8226-0007 of course it aint said missus bozzle
 3536-8226-0011 ill tell you what it is b exclaimed missus bozzle its my belief as he aint quite right up here and missus bozzle touched her forehead
 3536-8226-0012 drat em a what is it they wants they dont know what they want
 3536-8226-0024 i do not suppose that anybody will question my right to have the care of my own child said travelion
 3536-8226-0025 if you would have gone to mister skint sir suggested bozzle
 3536-8226-0026 as he went about his eyes were ever cast downwards and he walked with a quick shuffling gait and he suspected others feeling that he himself was suspected
 3576-138058-0003 who is touching me and untrussing me
 3576-138058-0031 what are you talking about the man
 3576-138058-0033 at this instant one or two of those squires who were posted as sentinels on the roads to watch who came along them and report what passed to their chief came up and said senor there is a great troop of people not far off coming along the road to barcelona
 3752-4943-0003 what is he more than anybody else said the wretched man to himself as he hugged his misery close
 3752-4943-0008 and beat on the bars with white and sweating hands
 3752-4943-0016 do him good curse him
 3752-4943-0026 oh mister north says kirkland why did you stop me
 3752-4944-0004 if you please said meekin gravely
 3752-4944-0008 so he is a friend of yours an
 3752-4944-0009 i had the pleasure of meeting him in society
 3752-4944-0010 he is just married you know is he said burgess
 3752-4944-0013 in fact the ringleader john rex gave me his confession and i sent it to the bishop
 3752-4944-0016 he seems to me to be truly penitent for his offences a misguided but not a hypocritical man if my knowledge of human nature goes for anything i hope he is said north
 3752-4944-0017 there is no fear of him said burgess cheerily if he grows aprorious well soon give him a touch of the cat
 3752-4944-0025 the mackawane was tired and wanted to get home
 3752-4944-0031 perhaps you will have the goodness to allow me to be the best judge of that returned mackawine drawing up his little body to its least insignificant stature
 3752-4944-0034 i shall find my port monte in my room you said yes yes
 3752-4944-0036 an impulsive gentleman said meekin to macawane as a sound of mister norths footsteps died away in the distance
 3752-4944-0043 ill teach my prisoners to attempt suicide
 3752-4944-0046 ive given my orders sir
 3752-4944-0053 jemister north out he said and go down to the barracks and tell troke that curoklin is to have a hundred lashes to morrow
 3752-4944-0058 ill report this to the government
 3752-4944-0069 in the midst of his arguments he found himself at the cupboard with the bottle at his lips in an attitude that was at once ludicrous and horrible
 3853-163249-0003 nothing can surprise me now im prepared for any thing even the sight of my quakerish lover dancing a jig
 3853-163249-0022 you will let me do it and in return i will marry you whenever you ask me answered christie sealing the promise with a kiss that silenced him
 3853-163249-0032 can you remember whatrhaps he told us and call them poor long sufferin credo's names
 3853-163249-0038 the women dropped their work to look and listen for his visits to a few and short and every instant was precious
 3853-163249-0042 as a married woman you will get on better as my wife you will be allowed to come to me if i need you and as my he stopped there for he could not add as my widow you will have my pension to support you
 3853-163249-0045 then they stood quite still for a time and in the silence the two hearts talked together in the sweet language no tongue can other
 3853-163249-0052 david in christy went smiling away together and if they shed any terosofer the brief happiness no one saw them but the flowers and they loyally kept the secret folded up in their tender hearts
 3853-163249-0056 i could not love thee dear so much loved i not honor more
 422-122949-0001 the distinctions of moral values have either originated in a ruling caste pleasantly conscious of being different from the ruled or among the ruled class the slaves and dependents of all sorts
 422-122949-0006 here is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis good and evil power and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil a certain dreadfulness subtlety and strength which do not admit of being despised
 422-122949-0008 everywhere that slave morality gains the ascendancy language shows a tendency to approximate the significations of the words good and stupid
 422-122949-0012 variations whether they be deviations into the higher finer and rarer or deteriorations and monstrosities appear suddenly on the scene in the greatest exuberance and splendour the individual dares to be individual and attach himself
 5338-24615-0002 occasionally indeed when such a consummation seemed inevitable a watchful old grandam with her close cap distaff and spindle rushed like a civil in frenzy out of one of these miserable cells dashed into the middle of the path and snatching up her own charge from among the cunforctloiterers saluted him with a sound cup and transported him back to his dungeon the little white headed varlet screaming all the while from the very top of his lungs a shrilly travel to the growling remonstrances of the enraged matron
 5338-24615-0004 yet the physiognomy of the people when more closely examined was far from exhibiting the indifference of stupidity their features were rough but remarkably intelligent grave but the very reverse of stupid and from among the young women an artist might have chosen more than one model whose features and form resembled those of minerva
 5338-24615-0006 it was one of those effects which a painter loves to represent and mingled well with the struggling light which found its way between the bars of the shady arch that vaulted the broad green alley
 5338-24615-0007 the house which seemed to consist of two or three high narrow and steep roofed buildings projecting from each other at right angles formed one side of the inclosure
 5338-24615-0010 stables and other offices occupied another side of the square
 5338-24615-0013 the court was spacious well paved and perfectly clean there being probably another entrance behind the stables for removing the litter
 5338-24640-0007 he had neither sympathy with my innocence nor with my wretchedness and the petrifying accuracy with which he attended to every form of civility while he tortured me by his questions his suspicions and his inferences was as tormenting as the racks of the inquisition
 5338-284437-0003 exclaimed trot of course
 5338-284437-0006 they seem very ignorant poor things said another in reply
 5338-284437-0014 are you a giant
 5536-43358-0006 the first man day or religious retreat marked an i pack in the life of the youth which may be compared to that of confirmation or conversion in the christian experience
 5536-43359-0007 the remoter degrees of kinship were fully recognized and that not as a matter of form only first cousins were known as brothers and sisters the name of cousin constituted a binding claim and a rigid morality forbade marriage between cousins in any known degree or in other words within the clan
 5536-43363-0001 therefore he courts death in battle on the other hand he would regard it as disgraceful to be killed in a private quarrel
 5536-43363-0006 if a man were slain in battle it was an old custom to place his body against a tree or rock in a sitting position always facing the enemy to indicate his undaunted defiance and bravery even in death
 5536-43363-0013 another famous medicine man was born on the rum river about one hundred and fifty years ago and lived to be over a century old
 5694-64025-0011 i have befitting me in all the morning as if i had stolen a sheep but when they wanted to charge was given i got happy
 5694-64025-0012 officers could not curb the men to keep in line
 5694-64025-0016 about the time he pulled trigger a stray ball from some direction struck him in the side and he fell off dead and his horse becoming frightened galloped off dragging him through the confederate lines
 5694-64025-0018 it was wise in his own conceit
 5694-64025-0021 so he got a large two inch rope tied one end around the mules neck and the other to the caisson and ordered the driver to whip up
 5694-64029-0002 our army stopped at murferysborrowh
 5694-64029-0003 from time to time different regiments were sent forward to do picket duty
 5694-64029-0025 i thought it had been torn from my shoulder
 5694-64038-0003 outside of these occasional reminders we could see no evidence of the desolation of the track of an invading army
 5694-64038-0005 he walked up and says hello boys what is it boss
 5694-64038-0006 ayankiolwysasnagger
 5694-64038-0018 we were inured to privations and hardships had been upon every march in every battle in every skirmish in every advance in every retreat in every victory in every defeat
 5694-64038-0021 you see jim knowed the law
 5694-64038-0024 a regiment was sent to the attack it was jims regiment
 5895-34615-0000 but is laughter a synonym of joy
 5895-34615-0006 he showed himself on the platform
 5895-34615-0007 it was gwynplaines laugh which created the laughter of others yet he did not laugh himself
 5895-34615-0009 no one could escape from this rictus
 5895-34615-0015 the joyous convulsion of laughter was as a tribute paid they submitted to it gladly but almost mechanically
 5895-34622-0000 what true things are told in stories
 5895-34622-0007 the astonishment with which the villagers regarded this machine was overwhelming
 5895-34622-0014 for these read fibi and vinos that we may conform to english pronunciation
 5895-34629-0004 it might have been ordered for the green box
 5895-34629-0006 against this wall was placed the green box which they were able to draw into the yard owing to the height of the gate
 5895-34629-0014 wgenplaine ate up their public
 5895-34629-0019 the glory of gwynplaine had not passed london bridge
 5895-34629-0020 these were remarkable talents
 6241-61943-0004 but no ghost or anything else appeared upon the ancient walls
 6241-61943-0009 the valery kept off the coast steering to the westward
 6241-61943-0010 on all sides were to be seen whole schools of whales and sharks
 6241-61943-0012 the fact was that scarcely any one of them but expected some goods by the periodical vessel
 6241-61943-0013 then without further remark he put his finger to his lips frowned darkly and descended into the small boat which awaited us
 6241-61943-0022 they were now however absent on duty
 6241-61946-0002 our two horses with the luggage followed of their own accord without requiring whip or spur
 6241-61946-0003 geographers have divided it into four parts and we had to cross the southwest quarter which in the vernacular is called suidvestferdinger
 6241-61946-0013 little did i expect however the spectacle which awaited us when we reached the peninsula of sneffels where agglomerations of natures ruins form a kind of terrible chaos
 6241-66616-0007 the other was a girl three years younger and newsome insisted that she be called minnetaki
 6241-66616-0024 on the tenth of october he would meet right at sprucewood on the black sturgeon river
 6295-244435-0012 europe which must have its cotton which favor the success of the south
 6295-244435-0014 i revere at once wrote an order
 6295-244435-0017 harry feeling pride but not showing it saluted and left the room going at once to madame de lines where he had left his baggage
 6295-244435-0018 he intended to leave early in the morning but first he sought his friends and told them good bye
 6295-244435-0025 but he looked back at charleston the gay the vale on the beautiful with real affection
 6295-244435-0031 the air too was unlike that of south carolina there was a sharper tang to it
 6295-244435-0037 if youve got pistols just you think once before you shoot said collins
 6295-64301-0002 was there ever a happier man than joseph that night as he strode along the footpath
 6295-64301-0019 it cried aloud that eternity was very long and like a great palace without a quiet room
 6295-64301-0021 i love thee i love thee cried the violin and the worship was entreaty that knew not itself
 6295-64301-0030 his violin was broken but his being was made whole
 6295-64301-0032 its just like him he murmured
 6313-66125-0002 yes agreed tad that does look like bushes

 6313-66129-0005 jim explained chunky stretching his neck and eyeing the dish longingly
 6313-66129-0016 the boys were now all anxiety to start while the ponies after their sunday rest were almost as full of life as were their owners
 6313-66129-0020 the great green field surreded on all sides by tall trees made the place an ideal one for their purpose
 6313-66129-0022 all agreed that tads superior horsemanship alone had won the race for him
 6313-66129-0023 gallepingedthecampstheboyfetchdisumebraro which he carried well out into the field and tossed away

 6319-275224-0002 your cousin the wild convolvinus whom i left in the fields this morning does no such thing i assure you
 6319-275224-0015 before the day closed the gardener came whistling from his farm work to look over his pretty charges
 6319-275224-0019 in this position she remained until a gentle hand was laid upon her shoulder
 6319-57405-0012 when at last they reached the plain they found themselves at the head of a noble company of human beings all eager to serve them
 6319-64726-0003 it is true i cannot entirely undo what my elder has done
 6319-64726-0006 he knew that she would not awake for a hundred years
 6319-64726-0009 scarcely had he come to the wood when all the trees and thorns which had made such an impenetrable thicket opened on one side and the other to offer in the path
 6319-64726-0016 meanwhile all the rest of the people in the castle had been wakened at the same moment as the princess and they were now extremely hungry
 6319-64726-0019 the violins and who boys played old but excellent pieces of music and after supper to lose no time the grand almoner married the royal lovers and the chapel of the castle
 6345-64257-0007 but she knew nobody and wandered alone in the garden oppressed with something she did not understand
 6345-64257-0014 he came to her side and she gave him no greeting
 6345-93302-0001 her hands should have been full of bluebells and she should have held them up to his face in maidenly defence as he sprang forward to take her in his arms
 6345-93302-0003 she had to the full limit allowed of her reading and her environment the literary sense
 6345-93302-0008 he had been late he had offered no excuse no explanation
 6345-93302-0017 following the tingle of relief came a sharp sickening pinch of jealousy and mortification these inspired her
 6345-93302-0023 i didnt think a decent man could do such things she was pulling on her gloves go home and gloat over it all
 6345-93302-0026 and he strode down between the marble tables and out by the swing door there was a very good exit
 6345-93302-0027 at the corner he remembered that he had gone away without paying for the tea and his natural impulse was to go back and remedy that error
 6345-93302-0028 he checked the silly impulse
 6345-93306-0010 he had no time to think but he was aware that this was the most exciting adventure that had ever happened to him
 6345-93306-0012 her little foot tapped the gravel impatiently
 6345-93306-0015 well then i went into lodgings that wicked woman had left me one street suit and to day they turned me out because my money was all gone
 6345-93306-0020 it wasnt i who said that said the girl smiling but thats so anyhow and then she sighed

 652-130726-0002 one of his waiters phil tyson was one of the earlier ones to go back into the burned district to begin business and he opened a restaurant called the del monte and powlstraetiner market but it was too early for success and closed after a short career
 652-130726-0010 at the two mentioned one pays for the surroundings as well as for the food and sometimes this is worth paying for 
 652-130726-0017 of course these are not the entire menus but of all the well prepared dishes these are their best

 777-126732-0008 his ennociation would have been almost totally unintelligible to a stranger
 777-126732-0024 the shadow of his evil gift clung to him yet like the smell of a duly drug in an old vial of poison emptied now useless ready to be thrown away upon the rubbish heap of things that had served their time
 777-126732-0032 his scared eyes blaze of indignation it would hurt terribly his mouth dropped open
 777-126732-0033 comrade ossipons face twitched with exasperation
 777-126732-0036 the coals in the grate settled down with a slight crash and the calos the hermit of visions in the desert of a penitentiary got up impetuously
 777-126732-0037 the disdainful pout of comateosipins thick lips accentuated the negro type of his face
 777-126732-0038 he paused and added with a modest firmness
 777-126732-0053 he stood still in the middle of the parlour and looked into the kitchen in silence
 777-126732-0066 there was no young man of his age in london more willing and docile and stephen she affirmed none more affectionate and ready to please and even useful as long as people did not upset his poor head
 777-126732-0075 he glared at me as if i didnt know who i was when i went downstairs
 7850-111771-0005 he was now commander of all the federal forces
 7850-111771-0009 his success seems to have been the outgrowth of hard study and ability to perform the most exhaustive labor without fatigue
 7850-281318-0004 and the poor silly things ruffled up their feathers and looked miserable as only a little bird can look when it is unhappy
 7850-281318-0007 and she saw all the other birds hopping about and twittering helplessly
 7850-281318-0010 oh why is mother magpie dear mother magpie they cried teach us how to build our nests like yours for it is griwly night and we are tired and sleepy
 7850-281318-0014 and some of the birds who were attentive and careful soon saw how it was done and started nice homes for themselves

 1272-141231-0003 his instant panic was followed by a small sharp blow high on his chest

 1272-141231-0006 the buzzers were trikaedhismuscles and complete relaxation
 1272-141231-0008 he was in reverie sliding along the borders of consciousness
 1272-141231-0019 there could be little art in this last and final round of fencing
 1272-141231-0029 he said it was the last burst of energy he knew how closely both were to exhaustion

 174-168635-0003 he suffered all the pangs of a mother and he knew not what it meant for that great and singular movement of a heart which begins to love is a very obscure and a very sweet thing

 174-84280-0004 and already this astounding blow begins to take its place among other events as a thing strange and terrible indeed but related to all the strangeness and mystery of life part of the universal mysteries of despair and futility and death that have troubled my consciousness since childhood
 174-84280-0011 but now it doesnt seem to matter very much

 1993-147149-0011 then the mother lifted up her voice and wept
 1993-147149-0017 oh jem dont give way so i cannot bear to see you
 1993-147149-0018 he did not speak as though fearing to destroy by sound or motion the happiness of that moment when her soft hands touch thrilled through his frame and her silvery voice was whispering tenderness in his ear
 1993-147149-0025 i think i cannot go right for i have to check myself till im downright cross to him or else i speak just natural and thats too kind and tender by half
 1993-147149-0026 but will he think before it

 1993-147965-0000 grandfather came down wearing a white shirt and his sunday coat
 1993-147965-0002 he gave thanks for our food and comfort and prayed for the poor and destitute in great cities where the struggle for life was harder than it was here with us
 1993-147966-0002 your mama i said angrily wants other peoples things
 2035-147960-0002 one day when i rode over to the shimerdas i found antonia starting off on foot for russian peters house to borrow a spade ambrosch needed
 2035-147960-0004 it was on one of these gravel beds that i met my adventure
 2035-147960-0008 a faint fetid smell came from him and a thread of green liquid oozed from his crushed head
 2035-147960-0011 we decided that antony i should write do at home and i would walk
 2035-147961-0012 he lay patiently fighting for breath like a child with croup
 2035-147961-0021 something happened to the hindmost sledge the driver lost control he was probably very drunk the horses left the road the sledge was caught up in a clump of trees and overturned
 2035-147961-0031 peter crouching in the front seat saw nothing
 2035-147961-0032 the first thing either of them noticed was a new sound that broke into the clean air louder than that had ever heard it before the bell of the monastery of their own village ringing for early prayers
 2035-147961-0034 wherever they went the story followed them
 2035-147961-0038 the loss of his two friends had a depressing effect upon old mister shimerda
 2035-147961-0039 when he was out hunting he used to go into the empty log house and sit there brooding
 2035-152373-0001 the ancestors of the present pretender congal surnamed the squint eyed had twice received and cherished the licentious bards when under the ban of tara and his popularity with that still powerful order was one prop of his ambition

 2078-142845-0010 italian millet or great indian millet is cultivated in egypt and nubia where it is called dora and is used as human food as well as for the fermentation of beer

 2078-142845-0027 never use new bread for making any kind of toast as it eats heavy and besides is very extravagant
 2078-142845-0028 move it backwards and forwards until the bread is nicely coloured then turn it and toast the other side and do not place it so near the fire that it blackens
 2078-142845-0030 a loaf of household bread about two days old answers for making toast better than cottage bread the latter not being a good shape and too crusty for the purpose
 2078-142845-0031 cut as many nice even slices as may be required rather more than one quarter inch in thickness and toast them before a very bright fire without allowing the bread to blacken which spoils the appearance and flavour of all toast

 2086-149220-0005 these two strange to say had thought it worth their while to come hither possibly from the range of hives beside some farm house miles away
 2086-149220-0008 it was evident that the race had degenerated like many a noble race besides in consequence of too strict a watchfulness to keep it pure
 2086-149220-0022 if you would permit me said the artist looking at the i should like to try whether that the garrotype can bring out disagreeable traits on a perfectly amiable face
 2086-149220-0029 i can assure you that this is a modern face and one which you will very probably meet
 2086-149220-0034 if the original is still in the world i think he might defy the sun to make him look stern and hard
 2086-149220-0036 it is nonsense said phoebe a little impatiently for us to talk about a picture which you have never seen
 2086-149220-0037 since you are a friend of my cousin hepsipose you should ask her to show you the picture
 2086-149220-0043 what an instrument is the human voice

 2086-149220-0046 pray go to bed for i am sure you must need rest
 2277-149874-0006 the walls of the rooms were discordantly papered
 2277-149874-0020 it gave an imposing appearance to most of the wholesale houses whose offices were upon the ground floor and in plain view of the street
 2277-149874-0021 these vast buildings what were they
 2277-149896-0004 how would the papers talk about it
 2277-149896-0005 many little wrinkles gathered between his eyes as he contemplated this and his brow moistened
 2277-149896-0007 he would see how things turned out to morrow and then he would talk to her they were going to meet as usual
 2277-149896-0013 he would get one to day it would probably be on his desk when he got back he would look for it at once
 2277-149896-0020 then he sat down in his chair and gazed without seeing contemplating the result of his work
 2277-149896-0021 what would she do about that the confounded wretch
 2277-149896-0027 hurstwood almost exclaimed out loud at the insistency of this thing
 2277-149896-0029 he would have some arrangement of this thing
 2277-149896-0033 then he rang the bell no answer
 2277-149897-0005 it was with great opposition after two or three hours of the most urgent mental affirmation and denial that at last he got an onvhelip placed in it the requested amount and slowly sealed it up
 2277-149897-0012 if he only had that letter back he wouldnt send it
 2277-149897-0017 how about that now his pain at her failure to meet or write him rapidly increased as he devoted himself to the subject
 2277-149897-0021 he thought a busy saturday ushered out the sabbath in and nothing done
 2277-149897-0028 he would explain to her just where he stood and how much he needed her
 2277-149897-0029 he did manage to bring himself into the mood to go out to carry but when he got in ogden place he thought he saw a man watching him and went away
 2277-149897-0037 if he didnt go and see them they would sue him promptly
 2412-153947-0005 i am surprised however that the book at which such an example of the specious misuse of analogy would seem most naturally levelled should have occurred to know her a viewer neither shall i mention the name of the book cure though i should fancy that the hint given will suffice
 2412-153947-0010 i see from my second preface that i took the book to missieur'schadenandhall may first eighteen seventy one and on their rejection of it under the advice of one who has attained the highest rank among living writers i let it sleep till i took it to mister trubner early in eighteen seventy two
 2412-153948-0006 i was to see the sheep not necessarily close at hand nor to get them in a single mob but to see enough of them here and there to feel easy that nothing had gone wrong this was no difficult matter for there were not above eight hundred of them and being all breeding us they were pretty quiet
 2412-153948-0010 the country was the grandest that can be imagined
 2412-153948-0011 so lonely and so solemn with the sad grey clouds above and no sound save a lost lamb bleating upon the mountain side as though its little heart were breaking
 2412-153948-0012 each must cry louder and wander farther yet may luck be with them both that they may find their own at nightfall
 2412-153948-0015 i would try to near a range and see how far i could go
 2412-153954-0006 their expression was divine and as they glanced at me timidly but with parted lips in great bewilderment i forgot all thoughts of their conversion in feelings that were far more earthly
 2412-153954-0012 the country was highly cultivated every ledge being planted with chestnuts walnuts and apple trees from which the apples were now gathering
 2412-153954-0019 but by and by they came to my watch which i had hidden away in the inmost pocket that i had and had forgotten when they began their search
 2412-153954-0021 we passed many cases and at last came to one in which there were several clocks and two or three old watches
 2428-83699-0002 the reply was written in a sprawling feminine hand it was a little vague
 2428-83699-0012 i felt quite lively myself as i mingled with the christmas crowd looking for things which might not turn out to be absolutely preposterous
 2428-83699-0018 no one had come to meet me the village was about a half a mile and hangar dene the house for which my steps were bent about four miles by the road how far it was across ploughed fields my informant did not mention
 2428-83699-0019 there was a trap at the boy and blunderbuss but that required fetching
 2428-83699-0024 i was chilled to the bone wet tired hungry
 2428-83699-0025 i had long been wishing that an old fashioned christmas had been completely extinct before i had thought of adventuring in quest of one
 2428-83699-0028 there is a knocker if none of em havent twisted it off
 2428-83699-0040 after a vast amount of unfastening the door was opened and on the threshold there stood a girl with a lighted candle in her hand
 2428-83705-0003 it is most delightful
 2428-83705-0004 it might just as well be some one elses wedding so unimportant is the part which i am set to play in it
 2428-83705-0005 for instance look at their behaviour in the matter of the ring
 2428-83705-0009 thats it on your account
 2428-83705-0026 of course there are some people with whom you cant be perfectly plain but i shall be as plain as i can theres a way and a manner of doing that kind of thing
 2428-83705-0029 i notice that they are generally persons who have already tendered their offerings
 2428-83705-0031 such is the selfishness of human nature
 2428-83705-0040 we are going for our honeymoon to italy and the south of france
 2428-83705-0041 a second cousin of mary anns is in the cooks tours line
 251-118436-0008 with a long stained fingernail he mapped the constellations on the marble tiled floor
 251-118436-0018 i know now what brings me to the pyre
 251-136532-0003 the civilian specialists in other fields and the space force people who had been holding tape lines and making sketches and snapping cameras were all flying to lower syrtis to find out how much oxygen there was and what kind of life it supported
 251-136532-0004 they had four or five species of what might loosely be called birds and something that could easily be classed as a reptile and a carnivorous mammal the size of a cat with birdlike claws and a herbehore almost identical with the piglike thing in the big darfhulva mural and another like a gazelle with a single horn in the middle of its forehead
 251-136532-0005 the daily newscasts from terra showed a corresponding shift in interest at home
 251-136532-0009 well of course theyre dead what a question
 251-136532-0018 without question he had become overnight the most widely known archaeologist in history
 251-136532-0023 the organization of a society of martian archeology with anphinyladomeraphd the logical candidate for the chair
 251-137823-0004 electronic equipment cascaded from the wall shelves and a heavy duty chain hoist came loose from its overhead track plunging to the floor with a terrifying crash
 251-137823-0021 mister swift came into the living room just then and told tom how worried missus swift and sandy had been
 251-137823-0023 hes a great scientist
 2803-154320-0001 john mangles therefore hoped that the wretched hole would reach port without accident but it grieved him that his companions should have to suffer so much discomfort from the defective arrangements of the break
 2803-154320-0002 their friends did their best to amuse him
 2803-154328-0003 sleep which keeps all sorrow in abeyance soon weighed down their eyelids they slept in each others arms overcome by exhaustion and prolonged watching
 2803-154328-0008 i believe said john that in the sight of god i have a right to fulfill that promise
 2803-154328-0022 round his body was rolled a long coil of flax rope
 2803-161169-0006 look a little closer while our guide lets the light of his lamp fall upon the black wall at her side
 2803-161169-0011 what should we have done if everybody had kept on burning wood to this day
 2803-161169-0013 then the hills were piled up on top of it all but here and there some edge of a coal bed was tilted up and appeared above the ground
 2902-9006-0000 one who writes of such an era labours under a troublesome disadvantage
 2902-9006-0001 in the present case that disadvantage is doubled for while the sins of the church however heinous were still such as admit of being expressed in words the sins of the heathen world against which she fought were utterly indescribable and the christian apologist is thus compelled for the sake of decency to state the churchs case far more weakly than the facts deserve
 2902-9006-0013 the huns singly their inferiors pressed them from behind with the irresistible weight of numbers italy with her rich cities and fertile lowlands beckoned them on to plunder as auxiliaries they had learned their own strength and roman weakness a casus belli was soon found
 2902-9006-0018 that wonderful metaphysic subtlety which in phrases and definitions too often unmeaning to our grosser intellect saw the symbols of the most important spiritual realities and felt it on the distinction between homaoseus and home iosius might hang the solution of the whole problem of humanity was set to battle in alexandria the ancient stronghold of greek philosophy with the feet remains of the very scientific thought to which it owed its extraordinary culture
 2902-9008-0008 what do i care for food
 2902-9008-0013 nought that such a creature as that disturbs me no created thing i hope can move my equanimity but if i could stoop to hate i should hate her at her
 3000-15664-0010 every crystal dances responsive to the touches of the sun and the currents of sap in the growing cells of all the vegetation are ever in a vital whirl and rush and though many feet and wings are folded how many are astir
 3000-15664-0021 regaining the low ground at the base of the mountain and holding on in your grand orbit you pass through a belt of juniper woods called the cedars to sheep rock at the foot of the shasta pass
 3000-15664-0024 large flocks dwell here from year to year winter and summer descending occasionally into the adjacent sage plains and lava beds to feed but ever ready to take refuge in the jagged crags of their mountain at every alarm
 3000-15664-0028 but neither the glorified woods on the one hand nor the lake on the other could at first hold the eye
 3000-15664-0029 then fell the gloaming making everything still more forbidding and mysterious
 3000-15664-0045 the great wilds of our country once held to be boundless and inexhaustible are being rapidly invaded and overrun in every direction and everything destructible in them is being destroyed
 3081-166546-0008 george

 3081-166546-0075 yes many times
 3081-166546-0080 i know she said what you were going to ask me now
 3170-137482-0008 this is the amusing adventure which closed our exploits
 3170-137482-0012 we took our three prisoners to a large boat
 3170-137482-0019 i picked it up and coming up to him just as he was going down the steps i handed it to him
 3170-137482-0020 i told him and he insisted upon my coming with him in the gondola saying that he would leave me at my house
 3170-137482-0041 they were not only good christians and faithful to the church but even real devotees and full of scruples
 3536-23268-0009 miss milner you shall not leave the house this evening sir
 3536-23268-0015 niece i command you not to stir out of the room this evening
 3536-23268-0026 forgive the duties of my office and believe that no one is half so much concerned if it robs you of any degree of happiness as i myself am
 3536-23268-0027 what he said he looked with so much sincerity that had she been burning with rage at his late behaviour she must have forgiven him for the regret which he so forcibly expressed
 3536-23268-0030 keep your appointment and be assured that i shall issue my commands with more circumspection for the future as i find how strictly they are complied with
 3536-8226-0008 the paternal parent has a right to his infants no doubt that was bozzles law
 3536-8226-0016 does one mister samuel bozzle live here asked ravalion
 3536-8226-0017 then bozzle came forward and introduced his wife
 3536-8226-0019 bozzle had always waited upon him with a decent coat and a well brushed hat and clean shoes
 3536-8226-0022 missus bozzle who well understood that business was business and that wives were not business felt no anger at this and handed her husband his best coat
 3576-138058-0012 dont guiojey did so and asked him what had happened to him and what he was afraid of
 3576-138058-0015 he was mounted upon a powerful horse and had on a coat of mail with four of the pistols they call petronels in that country at his waist

 3576-138058-0037 the captains showed plainly the concern they felt the regents lady was downcast and the pilgrims did not at all enjoy seeing their property confiscated
 3752-4943-0017 its hard for such yougens
 3752-4943-0024 just as he reached it however the figure of mister north rose from behind a pile of stones
 3752-4943-0025 coroklang jumped for the jetty missed his footing and fell under the arms of the chaplain
 3752-4944-0000 captain frere says that the scenery is delightful
 3752-4944-0001 abandoned indeed by god and man almost
 3752-4944-0007 i was quartered with him at sarah island
 3752-4944-0022 by and by a short figure smoking a cheroot came up out of the dark and proved to be doctor macklewain who had been prevented from attending the dinner by reason of an accident to a constable agnorfockbay which had claimed his professional attention
 3752-4944-0023 dead said doctor macklewain
 3752-4944-0032 mister meekin expressed some alarm but doctor macklewain re assured him
 3752-4944-0035 he sleeps at the back and north hurried off

 3752-4944-0057 they shall not flog that boy he said
 3752-4944-0061 o lord look down upon me
 3752-4944-0063 it relieved him for a while
 3752-4944-0064 it was as though he had reached the crisis of a disease which had been for days gathering force
 3853-163249-0002 so christy turned to defer to her prophetic soul and gave herself up to the blissful holiday that had come at last
 3853-163249-0005 im not a talker you know and as the laws of gravitation forbid my soaring aloft anywhere i can only express my joyfully uplifted state of mind by prancing as you call it
 3853-163249-0006 i dont want you to i love to see you so young and happy only you are not the old david and ive got to get acquainted with the new one
 3853-163249-0011 i shall wait for time to show

 3853-163249-0048 the roses are for they remind me of poor helen and the first work i did with david was arranging fires like these for a dead babys little coffin
 3853-163249-0053 a very simple little marriage feast but more love good will and tender wishes adorned the plain table than is often found at wedding breakfasts and better than any speech or song was lettys broken whisper as she folded her arms round davids empty chair when no one saw her heaven bless and keep and bring him back to us
 3853-163249-0054 all watched with quickened breath and proud souls that living wave blue below and bite with a steely glitter above as it flowed down the street and away to join the sea of dauntless hearts that for monks had rolled up against the south and ebtbackrettened with the blood of men like these
 422-122949-0000 every elevation of the type man has hitherto been the work of an aristocratic society and so it will always be a society believing in a long scale of gradations of rank and differences of worth among human beings and requiring slavery in some form or other
 422-122949-0010 in fact conformably to the slow rise of the democratic social order and its cause the blending of the blood of masters and slaves the original noble and rare impulse of the masters to assign a value to themselves and to think well of themselves will now be more and more encouraged and extended but it has at all times an older ampler and mormatically ingrained propensity opposed to it and in the phenomenon of vanity this older propensity overmasters the younger
 422-122949-0011 the most varied experience teaches it what are the qualities to which it principally owes the fact that it still exists in spite of all gods and men and has hitherto been victorious these qualities it calls virtues and these virtues alone it develops to maturity
 422-122949-0014 nothing but new wise nothing but new hows no common formulas any longer misunderstanding and disregard in men with each other decay deterioration and the loftiest desires frightfully entangled the genius of the race overflowing from all the cornticopies of good and bad a fortentiousimultaneousness of spring and autumn full of new charms and mysteries peculiar to the fresh still exhausted still unwearied corruption
 422-122949-0022 also in all loves and friendships one has the experience that nothing of the kind continues when the discovery has been made that in using the same words one of the two parties has feelings thoughts intuitions wishes or fears different from those of the other
 422-122949-0023 which ever groups of sensations within a soul awaken most readily begin to speak and give the word of command these decide as to the general order of rank of its values and determine ultimately its list of desirable things
 422-122949-0025 profound suffering makes noble it separates one of the most refined forms of disguise is epicurism along with a certain ostentatious boldness of taste which takes suffering lightly and puts itself on the defensive against all that is sorrowful and profound
 422-122949-0029 only name it whatever i have i offer thee
 422-122949-0035 and to those of a company that robish and cheerful vice politeness

 5338-24640-0008 they held conventicles in the open fields and being treated with great violence and cruelty by the scottish government more than once took arms during those reigns
 5338-284437-0000 it had no ornamentation being exceedingly plain in appearance
 5338-284437-0002 what that little cabin
 5338-284437-0011 what is it quarily she asked the woman
 5338-284437-0012 the queen gazed upon our friends with evident interest
 5338-284437-0017 carly do you consider majesty a proper word to use when addressing a queen
 5338-284437-0019 but surely that is all wrong said tormulinegravely
 5338-284437-0025 i have one great privilege
 5338-284437-0026 after my death the pink marble statue of me will be set up in the grand court with the statues of the other kings and queens who have ruled this land and all the pinkies in ages to come will then honor me as having been a just and upright queen that is my reward
 5338-284437-0028 it is much more desirable to be a private citizen happy and care free
 5338-284437-0029 yes it was wet an sticky all right agreed the sailor but the big frog helped us an we got through all right

 5536-43358-0000 the savage philosopher the dual mind
 5536-43358-0002 it was silent because all speech is of necessity feeble and imperfect therefore the souls of my ancestors assent to god in wordless adoration
 5536-43358-0007 knowing that god sets no value upon material things he took with him no offerings or sacrifices other than symbolic objects such as paints and tobacco
 5536-43358-0008 at the solemn hour of sunrise or sonstad he took up his position overlooking the glories of earth and facing the great mystery and there he remained naked erect silent and motionless exposed to the elements and forces of his arming for a night and a day to two days and nights but rarely longer
 5536-43358-0016 who may condemn his superstition
 5536-43358-0019 the historians of the white race admit that the indian was never the first to repudiate his oath
 5536-43359-0001 her attitude and secret meditations must be such as to instill into the receptive soul of the unborn child the love of the great mystery and a sense of brotherhood with all creation
 5536-43359-0002 the ordeal is best met alone where no curious or pitying eyes embarrass her where all nature says to her spirit tis love tis love the fulfilling of life
 5536-43359-0009 before this glaminey came upon us she could not find anywhere happier home than that created by the indian woman
 5536-43359-0012 and he becomes an old man he loves to make a notable effort to prove his gratitude
 5536-43359-0015 our honor is the guarantee for his safety so long as he is within the camp
 5536-43363-0000 reincarnation and the congress of spirits
 5536-43363-0014 at the age of about seventy five years he saved his band from utter destruction at the hands of their ancestral enemies by suddenly giving warning received in a dream of the approach of a large war party
 5694-64025-0005 on sunday morning a clear beautiful and still day the order was given for the whole army to advance and to attack immediately
 5694-64025-0006 we were supporting an alabama brigade
 5694-64025-0009 we had the pass over the ground where troops had been fighting all day
 5694-64025-0019 i frequently thought it would be pleasant to split the difference with that mule and i would gladly have done so if i could have gotten one half of his no
 5694-64025-0022 the rope however was stronger than the mules no and he was finally prevailed upon by the strength of the rope to cross the creek
 5694-64025-0023 and why taking the rope off he shook himself and seemed to say you think that you are mighty smart folks but you are a leetle too smart
 5694-64029-0008 my gun was at my feet and one step would get it
 5694-64029-0009 i made a quick glance over my shoulder and grabbed at my gun
 5694-64029-0019 we were right upon the yankee line on the wookersoneturnpite
 5694-64029-0028 he was walking along and all at once he dropped down and died without a struggle or a groan
 5694-64038-0009 the voice appeared to be overhead
 5694-64038-0019 he wanted to go by home and tell his wife and children good bye and to get his clothes it was no go
 5895-34615-0002 had gwynplaine when a child been so worthy of attention that his face had been subjected to transmutation why not
 5895-34615-0004 it seemed evident that a mysterious and probably a cold science which was to surgery what alcomme was to chemistry had chile his flesh evidently at a very tender age and manufactured his countenance with premeditation
 5895-34615-0017 besides this face those who had brought him up had given him the resources of a gymnast and an athlete
 5895-34615-0019 his hair having probably been dyed with some corrosive preparation had left it willie and rough to the touch
 5895-34622-0003 from sixteen eighty to seventeen o four a great change had taken place
 5895-34622-0008 this was the old establishment of ursus its proportions augmented by success and improved from a wretched booth into a theater
 5895-34622-0009 unknown people had worked upon his face he on the other hand had worked on his mind and behind this well executed mask he had placed all that he could have thought
 5895-34622-0012 the curiosity of one place exhausted they passed on to another
 5895-34622-0021 then i look perhaps like what i am
 5895-34629-0010 they began their performances
 5895-34629-0012 all southwork running crowds to admire the laughing man
 5895-34629-0016 even this comedian of jaws and claws was eclipsed in success
 5895-34629-0017 that success was prodigious still it remained local
 5895-34629-0018 it took a hundred and thirty years for the name of shakespeare to penetrate from england into france
 5895-34629-0021 besides this he her ranged like cicero as we have just seen sold his drugs attended sickness and even healed the sick
 5895-34629-0029 they had a great friend in this unknown visitor
 5895-34629-0033 at that hour there was no one in the fair ground except perhaps some reeling drunkard making staggering shadows in dark corners
 6241-61943-0000 on the second of the month at two in the morning our precious cargo of luggage was taken on board the good ship falkery
 6241-61946-0007 snow tempest impracticable roads rocks icebergs nothing stops him
 6241-61946-0010 my arms are right but my legs are getting a little stiff
 6241-61946-0011 here and there could be seen an isolated farm some solitary bur or iclyndoccows built of wood earth fragments of lava looking like beggars on the highway of life
 6241-61946-0017 to ride over salt water upon the back of a little horse seemed to me absurd
 6241-61946-0021 he says tide replied my uncle translating the danish word for my information

 6295-244435-0010 the progress of president davis to the new capital set in the very face of the foe was to be one huge triumph of faith and loyalty
 6295-244435-0011 there was not a single note of gloom
 6295-244435-0021 it was a different harry who started home late in april
 6295-244435-0026 it was almost buried now in flowers and foreliads
 6295-244435-0040 but he saw nothing that moved there no signal lights twinkled
 6295-64301-0001 it was the afternoon of a holiday and she had closed early
 6295-64301-0009 he was in a mood for music was he not
 6295-64301-0018 let but a mood be strong enough and the soul clothing itself in that mood as with a garment can walk abroad and haunt the world
 6295-64301-0023 when thou lovest man or woman or child yea or even dog aright then wilt thou no longer need that i tell thee how god and his christ would not be content with each other alone in the glories even of the eternal original love because they could create more love
 6313-66125-0000 youll all be over if you dont have a care
 6313-66125-0005 i could not think of allowing any of my charges to take so terrible a risk and
 6313-66125-0014 the maid sent his body swaying giddily from side to side

 6313-76958-0004 the pony did most of it admitted the lad i just gave him his head and thats all there was to it
 6313-76958-0006 none of you will be fit for duty to morrow
 6313-76958-0022 almost before the echoes of his voice had died away a shrill voice piped up from the tail end of the chuck wagon
 6313-76958-0029 tom the told the young gentlemen what would become of view if you were to serve bad meals to this apfithe calpuncers
 6319-275224-0000 what a fusses made about you my dear little friends
 6319-275224-0009 indeed not a flower escaped his mischievous suggestions
 6319-275224-0011 making a sort of eddying circuit round the garden he knocked over the convolvulus pole tore the strips from the stick that held up the white lily loosed all the carnation flowers from their fastenings broke the rose tree down and levelled the sweet peas to the ground
 6319-275224-0020 i am not thinking about the garden mamma replied the young girl without lifting up her face we can plant new flowers and tie up even some of these afresh
 6319-57405-0002 these men he said to his mighty company are nothing but a source of trouble
 6319-57405-0003 but men kept on fighting and robbing even while the rain was pouring down and the sea was coming up over the land
 6319-57405-0004 no one but docaliin the son of prometheus was ready for such a storm
 6319-57405-0008 we should like above all things said ducanian to see this land full of people once more for without neighbors and friends the world is a very lonely place indeed
 6319-57405-0009 go on down the mountain said mercury and as you go cast the bones of your mother over your shoulders behind you and with these words he leaped into the air and was seen no more
 6319-64726-0007 one said it was an enchanted castle another that witches lived there but most believed that it was occupied by a great ogre which carried thither all the children he could catch and ate them up one at a time for nobody could get at him through the wood
 6319-64726-0015 they talked for four hours and had not then said half that was in their heads to say
 6345-64257-0012 but living soul there could be none to meet
 6345-64257-0013 she had lost him years and years before and now she saw him he was there and she knew him
 6345-64257-0020 with that came a pang of intense pain
 6345-93302-0000 she herself should have been a poem a lyric in a white gown and green scarf coming to him through the long grass under the blossomed bows
 6345-93302-0002 you see that she knew exactly how a tryst is conducted in the pages of the standard poets and of the cheaper weekly journals
 6345-93302-0005 she only wished for may and the orchard instead of january and the dingy dusty waiting room the plain faced preoccupied travellers the dim desolate weather
 6345-93302-0011 her hands and feet were aching with cold
 6345-93302-0013 she said how frightfully cold it is
 6345-93302-0014 and yesterday i had a letter from her and she seems to expect to think and i thought i had to tell you darling
 6345-93302-0022 no its only painful for both of us
 6345-93306-0002 then there was silence then a sigh and the sound of light moving feet on the gravel
 6345-93306-0004 never had any act seemed so impossible
 6345-93306-0005 there is a seat in the garden at the side of the house again she hesitated
 6345-93306-0009 he hurriedly cut cake and pressed it upon her
 6345-93306-0011 its only that youre poor well thats nothing im poor too she laughed
 6345-93306-0017 i shall lock up all the doors and windows in the house and then i shall give you my latch key and you can let yourself in and stay the night here there is no one in the house
 652-129742-0011 set into a cold place to chill and become firm

 652-130726-0033 they also have as the chef in charge of the aolonedishes herbert formerly chef of one of the yacht clubs of the coast who claims to have the only proper recipe for making abalones tender
 652-130726-0034 under ordinary circumstances the abalone is tough and unpalatable but after the deft manipulation of herbert they are tender and make a fine dish either fried as chowder or olanuburg

 777-126732-0004 and ever since he had never managed to get is wait out as much as an ounce
 777-126732-0005 with his elbow presenting no appearance of a joint but more like a bend in a dumy's limb thrown over the back of a chair he leaned forward slightly over his short and enormous thighs to spit into the grate
 777-126732-0016 alexander ossopin got up tall in his threadbare blue serge suit under the low ceiling shook off the stiffness of long immobility and strolled away into the kitchen down two steps to look or ritevi' shoulder
 777-126732-0017 very characteristic perfectly typical
 777-126732-0035 his vision of truth had grown so intense that the sound of a strange voice failed to rout it this time
 777-126732-0040 they are nourishing their greed on the quivering flesh and the warm blood of the people nothing else
 777-126732-0043 he was not satisfied with his friends
 777-126732-0050 he took the cash box out of the drawer and turning to leave the shop became aware that stevie was still downstairs
 777-126732-0076 i wish he had never been to school missus verloc began again brusquely
 777-126732-0077 he gets a red face poring over them
 7850-281318-0005 she was indeed a clever bird
 7850-281318-0009 so in a great company they came fluttering hopping twittering up to the elm tree where mother magpie nestled comfortably in her new house
 7850-286674-0004 you would think that with six legs apiece and three joints in each leg they might walk quite fast yet they never did

 2277-149897-0018 he decided to write her care of the west side post office and asked for an explanation as well as to have her meet him
 6345-64257-0003 she stood for a moment on the hearth and in sad dreamy mood listened to the howling swoops of the wind making the house quiver and shake

 6241-66616-0000 but this power of discernment was denied them and only in after years with the loved ones of their own firesides close about them was the whole picture revealed
 2428-83699-0036 the information was greeted with what sounded uncommonly like a chorus of laughter

 422-122949-0019 the noble soul accepts the fact of his egoism without question and also without consciousness of harshness constraint or arbitrariness therein but rather as something that may have its basis in the primary law of things if he sought a designation for it he would say it is justice itself
 2412-153954-0017 the other looked pale and ill but he was marvellously self contained and it was impossible to say what was the matter with him
 1673-143396-0015 their murmurs were variously silenced by the sectaries who espoused and modified the double system of currenthis

 6345-93306-0000 the last strains of the ill treated ill fated intermezzo had died away and after them had died away also the rumbling of the wheels of the murder or sparrow organ that had so gaily executed that along with the nine other tunes of its repertory to the admiration of the house made at the window of the house opposite and the crowing delight of the two babies next door
 1462-170138-0023 in the half light he looked about at the stalls and boxes and smiled a little consciously recalling with amusement sir harrys judicial frown
 1272-135031-0004 the king is for disgrace in your friends are asking for you
 3752-4944-0051 this of course was mere bravado on the part of the commandant

 7850-281318-0020 much luck may you have
