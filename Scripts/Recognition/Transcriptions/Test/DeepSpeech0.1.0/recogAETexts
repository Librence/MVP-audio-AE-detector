AE_388 IT HAS NOT BEEN RUNNING SINCE LAST NIGHT OR IT WOULD BE FULL OF CURIOUS PEOPLE ALL THE TIME HUSTLING TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THIS PLACE
AE_230 THE SLANT OF THE MOON PRESAGED EVIL FOR THE KING OF THE THE STARS ARE IN TURMOIL THE SERPENT IN THE HOUSE OF THE ELEPHANT
AE_259 TOMS EYES FOCUSED IN HORROR ON THE WRECKAGE ENVELOPED BY STILL BILLOWING DUST
AE_581 THE ROSES ARE FOR THEY REMIND ME OF POOR HELEN AND THE FIRST WORK I DID WITH DAVID WAS ARRANGING FLOWERS LIKE THESE FOR A DEAD BABYS LITTLE COFFIN
AE_353 THE BOYS BELONG TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IS A WIDOWER
AE_81 YET THE ORIGINAL WEARS TO COMMON EYES A VERY DIFFERENT EXPRESSION
AE_819 SPRING CAME AND PASSED AND THEN SUMMER
AE_56 MODE PUT THE FLOUR INTO A BASIN MIX THE SUGAR WELL WITH IT MAKE A HOLE IN THE CENTRE AND STIR IN THE YEAST AND MILK WHICH SHOULD BE LUKEWARM WITH ENOUGH OF THE FLOUR TO MAKE IT THE THICKNESS OF CREAM
AE_431 THEY BELIEVED THAT THROUGH ME THEY POSSESSED THE PHILOSOPHERS STONE THE UNIVERSAL PANACEA THE INTERCOURSE WITH ALL THE ELEMENTARY HEAVENLY AND INFERNAL SPIRITS AND THEY HAD NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT THANKS TO MY SUBLIME SCIENCE THEY COULD FIND OUT THE SECRETS OF EVERY GOVERNMENT IN EUROPE
AE_896 WHATS THAT FOR DEMANDED NED WONDERINGLY
AE_270 MALE OR FEMALE HUMAN OR ANIMAL
AE_509 ITS HARD FOR SUCH YOUNG UNS
AE_891 ALL AGREED THAT TADS SUPERIOR HORSEMANSHIP ALONE HAD WON THE RACE FOR HIM
AE_942 IT IS TRUE I CANNOT ENTIRELY UNDO WHAT MY ELDER HAS DONE
AE_537 PERHAPS YOULL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO ALLOW ME TO BE THE BEST JUDGE OF THAT RETURNED MACAWANEDRAWINGUP HIS LITTLE BODY TO ITS LEAST INSIGNIFICANT STATURE
AE_552 HE MIXED A TEASPOON OF THIS IN A PANIC AND OF WATER AND DRANK IT
AE_4 I COULD NOT TAKE MY EYES OFF THE MAN IN THE BED
AE_677 AS GLADDEN RODE BY A ACURRIERRODUPANDTOLDHIMSOMETHING
AE_469 DOES ONE MISTER SAMUEL AS I LIVE HERE ASKED RVALION

AE_701 I CAN LIEANDACOLONELFRIERSSON'SATTENTIONTO THE YANKEES AND HE REMARKED WELL I DONT KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE YANKEES OR NOT BUT IF THEY ARE THEY WILL COME OUT OF THEIR MIGHTY QUICK
AE_638 ILL LOOK IN THE GREAT BOOK FIRST
AE_566 YES DAVID SISTER AND SWEETHEART ANSWERED BRAVELY FORGETTING IN THE FOUR OF THE MOMENT WHAT HEAVY CONSEQUENCES GOD MIGHT SEE FIT TO SEND GOOD
AE_404 WITH AN EDUCATION WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE ENSURED ME AN HONOURABLE STANDING IN THE WORLD WITH SOME INTELLIGENCE WIT GOOD LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND ENDOWED WITH THOSE ACCIDENTAL PHYSICAL QUALITIES WHICH ARE SUCH A GOOD PASSPORT INTO SOCIETY I FOUND MYSELF AT THE AGE OF TWENTY THE MEAN FOLLOWER OF A SUBLIME ART IN WHICH IF GREAT TALENT IS RIGHTLY ADMIRED MEDIOCRITY IS AS RIGHTLY DESPISED
AE_411 THIS IS THE AMUSING ADVENTURE WHICH CLOSED OUR EXPLOITS
AE_519 YOU HAVE NOT BEEN LONG IN THE COLONY MISTER MEEKIN
AE_34 THE TRIBUTE WAS AT THIS PERIOD ENORMOUS FIFTEEN THOUSAND HEAD OF CATTLE ANNUALLY
AE_637 YOU ARE NOT LIKE MY PEOPLE THE PINKIES AND THERE IS NO PLACE FOR YOU IN OUR COUNTRY
AE_111 SO LITTLE DID HE CONSIDER DREW A THAT IT NEVER ONCE OCCURRED TO HIM TO WORRY ABOUT HIS FINDING OUT
AE_703 WE WERE RIGHT UPON THE YANKEE LINE ON THE WILKERSON TURN PIPE
AE_225 BESIDES WHICH WE CAN ALWAYS SELL THE COUPONS AND RAILWAY PASSES WHICH WE DONT USE
AE_430 NOT VERY LONG I ANSWERED AND I WILL TEACH YOU AS YOU WISH ALTHOUGH THE HERMIT ASSURED ME THAT I WOULD DIE SUDDENLY WITHIN THREE DAYS IF I COMMUNICATED MY SCIENCE TO ANYONE BUT I HAVE NO FAITH WHATEVER IN THAT PREDICTION
AE_940 ONE OF THE YOUNG FAIRIES OVERHEARING HER AND FANCYING SHE MIGHT WORK SOME MISCHIEF TO THE LITTLE BABY WENT AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE HANGINGS IN THE HALL SO AS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE LAST WORD AND UNDO ANY HARM THE OLD FAIRY MIGHT WISH TO WORK
AE_187 I HAD LONG BEEN WISHING THAT AN OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMAS HAD BEEN COMPLETELY EXTINCT BEFORE I HAD THOUGHT OF ADVENTURING IN QUEST OF ONE
AE_321 IF THEY HAVE CAST OFF THE LONGER HEARD THEY HAVE NOT CAST OFF HYPATIA
AE_788 WHEN THEREFORE HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO ME IN THE LANGUAGE OF HORACE WE AT ONCE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER
AE_199 BUT IT IS QUITE PLAIN TO ME THAT ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MY WEDDING ARE GOING TO BE MADE BY THE SNELLINGS
AE_27 AS LEADING TO THE MENTION OF OTHER INTERESTING EVENTS WE MUST SET THIS INROAD CLEARLY BEFORE THE READER
AE_216 I NOTICE THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PERSONS WHO HAVE ALREADY TENDERED THEIR OFFERINGS
AE_662 OUR HONOR IS THE GUARANTEE FOR HIS SAFETY SO LONG AS HE IS WITHIN THE CAMP
AE_575 CAN YOU REMEMBER WHERHAPSHETOLDUSANDCALLTHEMPOORLONGSUFFERINGCREDO'SNAMES
AE_7 THE SICK MAN RAGED AND SHOOK HIS FIST
AE_478 HUNNOTREAGOREXCLAIMEDTHEMOKGUIODE
AE_98 TO HIM THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF HIS WIFES SISTER WAS A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE
AE_356 HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SUICIDE
AE_179 I HAVE NEVER KNOWN A MADGE AND YET FROM MY BOYHOOD UPWARD I HAVE DESIRED TO MEET ONE
AE_908 YOU WONT BE SO FAST TO WAKE UP HARD AND COWBOYS AFTER THAT I RECKON
AE_213 I KNOW WHAT MAMMA CAN AFFORD TO GIVE AND I WILL SEE IF SHE GIVES IT
AE_328 ARCTIC BEAUTY AND DESOLATION WITH THEIR BLESSINGS AND DANGERS ONLY BE FOUND HERE TO TEST THE ENDURANCE AND SKILL OF ADVENTUROUS CLAMOROUS BUT FAR BETTER THAN CLIMBING THE MOUNTAIN IS GOING AROUND ITS WARM FRTLEBASE ENJOYING ITS BOUNTIES LIKE A BEE CIRCLING AROUND A BANK OF FLOWERS
AE_901 THE PONY DID MOST OF IT ADMITTED THE LAD I JUST GAVE HIM HIS HEAD AND THATS ALL THERE WAS TO IT
AE_599 ON THIS ACCOUNT THE PEOPLE OF ONE NATION UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER BETTER THAN THOSE BELONGING TO DIFFERENT NATIONS EVEN WHEN THEY USE THE SAME LANGUAGE OR RATHER WHEN PEOPLE HAVE LIVED LONG TOGETHER UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS OF CLIMATE SOIL DANGER REQUIREMENT TOIL THERE ORIGINATES THEREFROM AN ENTITY THAT UNDERSTANDS ITSELF NAMELY A NATION
AE_37 SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN
AE_894 THE BOYS HOWLED WITH DELIGHT THAT IS ALL DID SAVE STACY BROWN
AE_375 THE OLD MANS EYES SHOT FIRE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY ONE FOOT SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR
AE_279 SO THAT ON THAT SCORE THERE IS LITTLE OR NO DANGER
AE_300 WHEN YOUR HANDS OR LIPS ARE CRACKED AND ROUGH FROM THE COLD DOES YOUR MOTHER EVER PUT ON GLISTERING TO HEAL THEM
AE_666 THEREFORE HE COURTS DEATH IN BATTLE ON THE OTHER HAND HE WOULD REGARD IT AS DISGRACEFUL TO BE KILLED IN A PRIVATE QUARREL
AE_242 GLORIOUS STANDISHOWHOHADROPPED IN FOR LUNCH WAS ON THE MEZZANINE FAIRLY SCREAMING INTO A RADIOPHONE EXTENSION DOESNT THAT A HALF OF THEM
AE_656 THE FAMILY WAS NOT ONLY THE SOCIAL UNIT BUT ALSO THE UNIT OF GOVERNMENT
AE_129 THE BOY HASTENED AWAY AND THE MANAGER FELL TO HIS MUSINGS
AE_774 THEY HAD A GREAT FRIEND IN THIS UNKNOWN VISITOR
AE_406 BESIDES I WAS OF OPINION THAT A MANS PROFESSION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE OUGHT TO SUPPLY HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO SATISFY ALL HIS WANTS AND THE VERY POOR PAY OF AN OFFICER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO COVER MY EXPENSES BECAUSE MY EDUCATION HAD GIVEN ME GREATER ONE THAN THOSE OF OFFICERS IN GENERAL
AE_428 HE WROTE THE QUESTION AND GAVE IT TO ME I READ IT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND EITHER THE SUBJECT OR THE MEANING OF THE WORDS BUT IT DID NOT MATTER I HAD TO GIVE AN ANSWER
AE_50 TO MAKE DRY TOAST
AE_932 THESE MEN HE SAID TO HIS MIGHTY COMPANY ARE NOTHING BUT A SOURCE OF TROUBLE
AE_222 WE ARE GOING FOR OUR HONEYMOON TO EMILY AND THE SOUTH OF FRANCE
AE_861 HAST THOU YET TO LEARN THAT THE LOVE OF THE HUMAN IS LOVE IS DIVINE IS BUT A LOWER FORM OF THE PART OF THE LOVE OF GOD
AE_112 HE WOULD GET ONE TO DAY IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ON HIS DESK WHEN HE GOT BACK HE WOULD LOOK FOR IT AT ONCE
AE_435 YOUR APARTMENT IS READY YOU MAY SEND YOUR CLOTHES YOU SHALL HAVE A SERVANT A GONDOLA AT YOUR ORDERS MY OWN TABLE AND TEN SEQUINS A MONTH
AE_793 I SAW BUT FEW INHABITANTS DURING MY EXCURSION BUT I MET A CROWD ON THE BEACH DRYING SALTING AND LOADING CODFISH THE PRINCIPAL ARTICLE OF EXPORTATION
AE_884 HE BURIED HIS BISCUIT UNDER A LAYER OF JAM OVER WHICH HE SPREAD A THICK COATING OF HONEY
AE_8 HE SEEMED TO BE CURSING PEOPLE WOULD ROUND HIM
AE_571 THE LOYAL FRENZY FELL UPON THE THREE QUIET WOMEN AND THEY COULD NOT DO TOO MUCH FOR THEIR COUNTRY
AE_605 THE HOUSES SEEMED MISERABLE IN THE EXTREME ESPECIALLY TO AN EYE ACCUSTOMED TO THE SMILING NEATNESS OF ENGLISH COTTAGES
AE_655 INDEED THE DISTINCTIVE WORK OF BOTH GRANDPARENTS IS THAT OF ACQUAINTING THE YOUTH WITH THE NATIONAL TRADITIONS AND BELIEFS
AE_787 THIS MIGHT A SCHOLAR SPOKE NO LANGUAGES SAVE ICELANDIC AND LATIN
AE_482 HE WAS MOUNTED UPON A POWERFUL HORSE AND HAD ON A COAT OF MAIL WITH FOUR OF THE PISTOLS THEY CALL PETRONELS IN THAT COUNTRY AT HIS WAIST
AE_186 I WAS CHILLED TO THE BONE WET TIRED HUNGRY
AE_387 WHEREVER SHE PLEASES ONLY I CANT WALK FAR
AE_16 NOW HIS MIDDLE HORSE WAS BEING ALMOST DRAGGED BY THE OTHER TWO
AE_104 SHE ASKED MINNIE FOR INK AND PAPER WHICH WERE UPON THE MANTEL IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN THE LATTER HAD GONE TO BED AT TEN GOT OUT DREW HIS CARD AND WROTE HIM
AE_253 INSIDE A SECRET ROCKET TELEMETERING DEVICE WAS MOUNTAIN ON ITS TEST AND
AE_780 NO MISTER HARDWIGG SAID THE CAPTAIN NO FEAR OF THAT
AE_221 SOMEONE SNIGGERED
AE_550 I WISH I HADNT TAKEN THAT BRANDY HE SAID FOOL THAT I AM
AE_512 JUST AS HE REACHED IT HOWEVER THE FIGURE OF MISTER NORTH ROSE FROM BEHIND A PILE OF STONES
AE_651 IN HIS OWN THOUGHT HE ROSE SUPERIOR TO THEM HE SCORNED THEM EVEN AS A LOFTY SPIRIT ABSORBED IN ITS STERN TASK REJECTS THE SOFT BEDS THE LUXURIOUS FOOD THE PLEASURE WORSHIPING GALLONS OF THE RICH NEIGHBOUR
AE_427 I DECLARED MYSELF QUITE WILLING FOR IT WAS NECESSARY TO BRAZEN IT OUT AFTER HAVING VENTURED AS FAR AS I HAD DONE
AE_480 DO QUIXOTE GAVE HIS PROMISE AND SWORE BY THE LIFE OF HIS THOUGHTS NOT TO TOUCH SO MUCH AS A HAIR OF HIS GARMENTS AND TO LEAVE HIM ENTIRELY FREE AND TO HIS OWN DISCRETION TO WHIP HIMSELF WHENEVER HE PLEASED
AE_370 THIS IS VERY GOOD OF YOU HE BEGAN GLANCING DOWN AT THE AGED DETECTIVES BUNDLED OF LAKES AND GENTLY PUSHING A CHAIR TOWARDS HIM
AE_11 GRADUALLY RELIEF CAME TO ALL OF US
AE_944 HE KNEW THAT SHE WOULD NOT AWAKE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS
AE_669 IF A MAN WERE SLAIN IN BATTLE IT WAS AN OLD CUSTOM TO PLACE HIS BODY AGAINST A TREE OR ROCK IN A SITTING POSITION ALWAYS FACING THE ENEMY TO INDICATE HIS UNDAUNTED DEFIANCE AND BRAVERY EVEN IN DEATH
AE_36 TO MAKE GOOD HOME MADE BREAD
AE_664 BUT TO HAVE A FRIEND AND TO BE TRUE UNDER ANY AND ALL TRIALS IS THE MARK OF A MAN
AE_558 I FEEL LIKE A BOY OUT OF SCHOOL OR RATHER A MAN OUT OF PRISON AND MUST ENJOY MY LIBERTY IN SOME WAY
AE_838 FOUR MONTHS HAD MADE GREAT CHANGES HE BORE HIMSELF MORE LIKE A MAN HIS MANNER WAS MUCH MORE CONSIDERED AND GRAVE
AE_554 TWICE HE PAUSED ON THE WAY TO THE SITTING ROOM AND TWICE WAS HE DRIVEN ON BY A POWER STRONGER THAN HIS WILL
AE_397 NO A VERY NATURAL ONE I SHOULD SAY
AE_634 AFTER MY DEATH THE PINK MARBLE STATUE OF ME WILL BE SET UP IN THE GRAND COURT WITH THE STATUES OF THE OTHER KINGS AND QUEENS WHO HAVE RULED THIS LAND AND ALL THE PINKIES IN AGES TO COME WILL THEN HONOR ME AS HAVING BEEN A JUST AND UPRIGHT QUEEN THAT IS MY REWARD
AE_363 I EMPHASISED COMPLACENTLY
AE_376 SHE HAD NO COMPANION NEAR HER
AE_680 THE FACT WAS KEPT FROM THE TROOPS
AE_567 THEN IT WILL TAKE THE GARDEN IN THE GREEN HOUSE OFF MY HANDS THIS AT HIM FOR A YEAR OR LONGER IF I LIKE
AE_904 THE COWBOY DID THIS VERY THING THOUGH WITHIN AN HOUR HE FOUND HIMSELF ALONE THE OTHERS HAD BEEN TURNED IN ONE BY ONE
AE_386 NOT ALTOGETHER BY ME
AE_264 THE TELEPHONE LINE WAS SOON REPAIRED AND A STEADY STREAM OF RESCUE VEHICLES BEGAN ARRIVING FROM HARKNESS FIRE TRUCKS THREE AMBULANCES AND PRIVATE CARS DRIVEN BY VOLUNTEERS
AE_6 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE DESPISED HIM FOR BEING SO SIMPLE AND DOCILE
AE_925 MEANWHILE HOW FARED IT WITH THE FLOWERS
AE_205 I WAS PERSUADED THAT SOMEBODY BESIDES THAT COUSIN GOT A PROFIT OUT OF MARY ANNS ENGAGEMENT RING BUT I HANDED OVER THE AMOUNT
AE_329 PERHAPS THE PROFESSION OF DOING GOOD MAY BE FULL BUT EVERY BODY SHOULD BE KIND AT LEAST TO HIMSELF
AE_275 GOD KEEP US FROM SUCH A MEETING WHY JOHN
AE_786 THE PROFESSOR KNEW WHOM HE HAD TO DEAL WITH
AE_195 WHO LIVES HERE ARE THE PEOPLE MAD
AE_528 HE SEEMS TO ME TO BE TRULY PENITENT FOR HIS OFFENCES A MISGUIDED BUT NOT A HYPOCRITICAL MAN IF MY KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE GOES FOR ANYTHING I HOPE HE IS SAID NORTH
AE_250 WITHOUT QUESTION HE HAD BECOME OVERNIGHT THE MOST WIDELY KNOWN ARCHAEOLOGIST IN HISTORY
AE_91 BUT PUT IT ON THE TABLE IN THE CORNER OF THE PASSAGE
AE_122 WHEN HURSTWOOD GOT BACK TO HIS OFFICE AGAIN HE WAS IN A GREATER QUANDARY THAN EVER
AE_489 SANCHO SAID THEY HAD BUT THAT THREE KERCHIEFS THAT WERE WORTH THREE CITIES WERE MISSING
AE_78 IF YOU WOULD PERMIT ME SAID THE ARTIST LOOKING AT PHOEBE I SHOULD LIKE TO TRY WHETHER THAT THE GAROTYPECANBRINGOUTDISAGREEABLETRAITS ON A PERFECTLY AMIABLE FACE
AE_579 NOT ONE DAY OF IT THATS TRUE LOVE CHRISTIE
AE_114 AT ONE THIRTY HE WENT TO RECTORS FOR LUNCH AND WHEN HE RETURNED A MESSENGER WAS WAITING FOR HIM
AE_506 THERE IS MORE TROUBLE WITH YOU BLOODY ARESTICRATSTHANENOUGHLIEQUIET
AE_366 I WISH WE HAD NOT LEFT SO SOON
AE_699 BAD GENERALSHIP I THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS
AE_474 AND HE DID GO AWAY LEAVING BOSSLESSTANDINGIN THE MIDDLE OF STONY WALK
AE_849 HE PRESSED HIS VIOLIN CASE TO HIS HEART AS IF IT WERE A LIVING THING THAT COULD KNOW THAT HE LOVED IT
AE_351 INSTANTLY THEY ABSORBED ALL MY ATTENTION THOUGH I DARED NOT GIVE THEM A DIRECT LOOK AND CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THEM ONLY IN THE GLASS
AE_424 DELIGHTED WITH SUCH A FORTUNATE RESULT WE LAY DOWN AGAIN
AE_863 A SOB LIKE A BIRD NEW BORN BURST FROM MARYS BOSOM
AE_586 WE TRUTHFUL ONES THE NOBILITY IN ANCIENT GREECE CALLED THEMSELVES
AE_549 ILL REPORT THIS TO THE GOVERNMENT
AE_194 THERE WAS A RUSH OF RETREATING FEET AN EXPOSTULATING VOICE THEN DARKNESS AGAIN AND SILENCE
AE_350 EVERY LANDSCAPE LOW AND HIGH SEEMS DOOMED TO BE TRAMPLED AND HARRIED
AE_690 THE FEDERAL ARMY WAS CONCENTRATING AT NASHVILLE THERE WAS NO REST FOR THE WEARY
AE_865 HIS VIOLIN WAS BROKEN BUT HIS BEING WAS MADE WHOLE
AE_808 WHILE THE ATTACK WAS SUCCESSFUL IN A WAY ITS MAIN PURPOSE FAILED
AE_670 AT EVERY MEAL TIME A DISH OF FOOD WAS PLACED UNDER IT AND SOME PERSON OF THE SAME SEX AND AGE AS THE ONE WHO WAS GONE MUST AFTERWARD BE INVITED IN TO PARTAKE OF THE FOOD
AE_823 ON THE TENTH OF OCTOBER HE WOULD MEET ROD AT BRUSWODONTHEBLACKSTURGEONRIVER
AE_483 IN A WORD HE PLEDGED HIMSELF TO BE MINE AND I PROMISED TO BE HIS WITHOUT CARRYING MATTERS ANY FURTHER
AE_233 THEY SEEK TO SNAP THE SILVER CORD THAT BINDS ME TO MY DYING BODY
AE_870 YOU HAVE OTHER WAS OF THE BOOM HE ELECTED TO YOU TO TAKE CARE OF THIS END
AE_449 MISS WOODLEY THOUGHT IT HER DUTY TO BE MUTE AND NOW THE GINGLE OF A TEA SPOON WAS LIKE A DEEP TONED BELL ALL WAS SO QUIET
AE_887 SUPER HAVING BEEN FINISHED THE PARTY GATHERED ABOUT THE CAMP FIRE FOR THEIR EVENING CHAT AFTER WHICH ADMONISHING STACY TO KEEP WITHIN HIS TENT AND NOT TO GO BORROWING TROUBLE THE BOYS TURNED IN FOR A SOUND SLEEP
AE_770 THIS CONNISSIRWASSUDDENLYFASCINATEDANDHAD ADOPTED THE LAUGHING MAN
AE_298 IT WAS ONLY A TROUBLE TO THE GAS MAKERS WHO HAD NO USE FOR IT AND EVEN THREW IT AWAY UNTIL SOME ONE MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN THE OTHERS FOUND OUT THAT WATER WOULD NOT PASS THROUGH IT
AE_845 BILL SCALLIINHISGANGTHENMOUNTANERSWEREUP
AE_269 TOM NODDED UNHAPPILY
AE_945 ONE SAID IT WAS AN ENCHANTED CASTLE ANOTHER THAT WHICH IS IS THERE BUT MOST BELIEVED THAT IT WAS OCCUPIED BY A GREAT OGRE WHICH CARRIED THITHER ALL THE CHILDREN HE COULD CATCH AND ATE THEM UP ONE AT A TIME FOR NOBODY COULD GET AT HIM THROUGH THE WOOD
AE_283 BOLINARVAN'SVOIYSFIRMTILNOWFALTERED
AE_59 ILLUSTRATION
AE_151 ON MY RETURN I PURPOSELY AVOIDED LOOKING INTO IT UNTIL I HAD SENT BACK MY LAST REVISES TO THE PRINTER
AE_72 THESE FEATHERED PEOPLE HAD EXISTED TOO LONG IN THEIR DISTINCT VARIETY A FACT OF WHICH THE PRESENT REPRESENTATIVES JUDGING BY THE LUGUBRIOUSDEPORTMENTSEEMEDTOBEAWARE
AE_905 THE LADS FOUND THAT A PAIR OF BLANKETS HAD ASSIGNED TO EACH OF THEM WITH AN ORDINARY WAGON SHEET DOUBLED FOR A CARLIN
AE_157 I REACHED MY DESTINATION IN ONE OF THE LAST MONTHS OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT BUT I DARE NOT MENTION THE SEASON LEST THE READER SHOULD GATHER IN WHICH HEMISPHERE I WAS
AE_276 WE COULD NOT EVEN FLY FLY JEN
AE_154 I MADE A FEW FURTHER VERY TRIFLING ALTERATIONS BEFORE MOULDS WERE TAKEN BUT SINCE THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO AS NEW EDITIONS WERE FROM TIME TO TIME WANTED THEY HAVE BEEN PRINTED FROM STEREOS THEN MADE
AE_178 THE WHOLE THING WAS A TRIFLE ODD
AE_928 BUT FOR THE SIGHT THAT AWAITED HIM HE WAS NOT PREPARED AT ALL
AE_160 SO LONELY AND SO SOLEMN WITH THE SAD GREY CLOUDS ABOVE AND NO SOUND SAVE A LOST LAMB BLEATING UPON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE AS THOUGH ITS LITTLE HEART WERE BREAKING
AE_807 BUT THIS POWER OF DISCERNMENT WAS DENIED THEM AND ONLY IN AFTER YEARS WITH THE LOVED ONES OF THEIR OWN FIRESIDES CLOSE ABOUT THEM WAS THE WHOLE PICTURE REVEALED
AE_547 SO MISTER NORTH OUT HE SAID AND GO DOWN TO THE BARRACKS AND TELL TROKE THAT CROKLINISTOTHAVEAHUNDREDLASHESTOMORROW
AE_94 PRAY GO TO BED FOR I AM SURE YOU MUST NEED REST
AE_461 AT LAST HE SENT WORD TO SAY THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD BE IN ENGLAND BEFORE THE END OF MARCH AND WOULD SEE THAT THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW SHOULD BE VINDICATED IN HIS FAVOUR
AE_358 A MAN WAS LOOKING IN FROM THE CARTER BEHIND A THE FOUR PERSONS WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING
AE_447 NIECE I COMMAND YOU NOT TO STIR OUT OF THE ROOM THIS EVENING
AE_460 AND NOW IT HAD COME TO PASS THAT HIS SOLE REMAINING ALLY MISTER SAMUEL BOZZLE THE EX POLICEMAN WAS BECOMING WEARY OF HIS
AE_55 PLAIN BUNS SEVENTEEN TWENTY NINE
AE_801 I TOOK OCCASION TO CONSULT THE MAP TO SEE WHERE GARDAR WAS TO BE FOUND
AE_485 THEY MADE HASTE TO OVERTAKE THEM WHICH AS THE PARTY MOVED SLOWLY THEY WERE ABLE TO DO WITH EASE
AE_75 THEY HAVE KNOWN ME MUCH LONGER BUT NEVER HONOR ME WITH ANY FAMILIARITY THOUGH HARDLY A DAY PASSES WITHOUT MY BRINGING THEM FOOD
AE_373 AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT WE HOPE
AE_929 IN THIS POSITION SHE REMAINED UNTIL A GENTLE HAND WAS LAID UPON HER SHOULDER
AE_473 IVE WATCHED AS SHARP AS WATCHING CAN GO PRETTY NEAR
AE_830 ALL THE AMENITIES WERE PRESERVED BETWEEN THE CAPTURED GARRISON AND THEIR CAPTORS
AE_47 SOUR MILK OR BUTTERMILK MAY BE USED BUT THEN A LITTLE LESS ACID WILL BE NEEDED
